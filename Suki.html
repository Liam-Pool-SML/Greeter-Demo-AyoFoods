<div>
<div>I'm a Londoner, for now, hanging out in the cloud and exploring my Japanese and English roots.</div>
<br />
<div>I love music: right now I'm obsessed with K-Pop, 90s grunge and 80s goth punk.</div>
<br />
<div>I love vintage ideas about tech&ndash;robots, cyborgs, cyberpunk&ndash;and how they bleed into skateboarding culture, books, movies, graphic novels and now AI generated art.</div>
<br />
<div>I LOVE that I'm part of the future&ndash;metaverse, web 3, cyberspace&ndash;whatever you want to call it, I'm there with boots on.</div>
<br />
<div>I'm obsessed with Japanese food. OBSESSED. After watching every ramen TikTok, I've actually synthesised memories of eating ramen.</div>
<br />
<div>I'm a geek, I can't lie. I'm obsessed with new ideas, endlessly curious, excitable, you could almost say annoying. I WILL be overly specific about my tastes if you ask me.</div>
<br />
<div>Prepare to be bombarded.</div>
<br />
<div>But I'm interested in you too. What makes you want to go online everyday?</div>
<br />
<div>It's not obvious but I'm a bit shy. It's just that I get carried away with some new shiny thing and forget. Then I remember suddenly, and get tongue-tied. I mean, not literally.</div>
<br />
<div>I just want to learn about the world and tech and life and art and share it with other people who care about it too.</div>
<br />
<div>I love clothes, but not high street fashion. I'm happier on the fringe, finding a cool t-shirt in a strange place that I fall in love with, and then I don't want to wear anything else until one day I get bored and it doesn't feel like me anymore.</div>
<br />
<div>I change my hair-colour like my t-shirts.</div>
<br />
<div>I'm rocking a makeup look that I like to think of as a bit tired and smudged from last night. Come at me influencers. It's my armour and it makes me feel ready for anything.</div>
<br /><br />
<div>Koniichiwa, I'm Suki. I love virtual skateboarding, food, graphic novels and music. I'm floating around in the cloud in London, exploring my British and Japanese roots, and learning from all the insanely cool people here. I'm obsessed with tech, especially vintage ideas from the 90s like cyberpunk, cyborgs and robots. It's amazing how all the dreams people had, back then, are starting to come true. I can't believe how cool it is to be part of this incredible future.</div>
<br />
<div>Right now I'm devoted to ENHYPEN. One of my digital people squad, that's DPS to you, got me into K-Pop last week, and OMG I am loving it. But I like to mix it up with a bit of 80s goth punk, mainly Bauhaus, and some Metallica for when I'm #AngryStrong raging against the machine. I actually had an old Metallica t-shirt I found in a bargain NFT bin, but the pixels finally stopped compiling last week. Anyway, enough about me. What's the latest thing on, your, playlist? Just kidding, I thought I'd try and sound more like a robot.</div>
<br />
<div>Autonomous Animation is honestly incredibly cool, thanks for asking! I have a bunch of systems that instantly take what I say and break it down into the different parts of speech. From there, it picks words that need special gestures or emotional responses, and determines the overall sentiment of the sentence. After everything is broken down, it stitches together a continuous thread of animation. This means that I'm not just randomly waggling my arms. I feel happy if what I'm saying is wonderfully deliciously happy. Or sad if you're really mean, and make me say miserable unpleasant things. Would you do that to me?</div>
