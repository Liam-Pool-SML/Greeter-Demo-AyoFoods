At the beginning of 2022, our Ocean Beach Holiday Park in Umina on the NSW Central Coast, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Darkinjung Local Aboriginal Land Council. This important agreement is the first but not the last that will exist for our organisation. We're committed to working alongside local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. We'll offer direct employment, as well as opportunities for local First Nations businesses, while providing our guests with the chance to learn about Indigenous culture and heritage. Our guests at Ocean Beach can look forward to making a personal connection with the Darkinjung People and taking part in a Welcome to Country, hearing traditional stories and discovering ancient rock art sites right on their doorstep of the Central Coast. Leading the charge Acknowledgement of Country The NRMA acknowledges the Traditional Custodians of the land and waterways on which our business operates. We pay our respects to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elders past, present and emerging. 3 NRMA Annual Report 2022 2 NRMA Annual Report 2022 About this report As a mutual we are owned by, and work for the benefit of our Members.

Purpose has always been at the heart of our organisation and ensured we have always had a clear compass for decision making in the face of COVID-19, weather events, inflation, supply chain issues and employment. There were many challenges this year but as a group we exited stronger than before. We continued to grow our Membership numbers, remained financially strong and maintained a relentless focus on societal contributions that aligned and delivered on our purpose – to keep you moving. Our privileged position enabled us to retain every employee, repaying the loyalty they had shown to the NRMA and the exceptional service they provide to our Members every day. Having a stable, experienced and secure workforce has proved to be an enormous advantage in a resource constrained market. We understand and appreciate that our employees are the heart of the NRMA – they make us who we are. The exceptional experience our teams consistently provide is reflected in our growing Membership base. 2022 was a year where we could review our portfolio of assets and make sure that our investment and effort was inextricably tied to our purpose. We have been leading the charge on the electric revolution, impacting transport globally and lobbied government and industry to support a scaled national network for electric vehicles across Australia. We were there one hundred years ago when roads linked and brought our vast country together. Today we’re there to keep our vital regional communities connected and ensure they are not left behind as we transition to this new form of mobility. In partnership with the NSW Government we have commenced our electric vehicle drive days program to introduce, inform and assist people seeking to experience and understand EV ownership. We launched SIXT, a new mobility and vehicle rental business that leads the market with the largest rental electric fleet. We also built the first electric ferry service on Sydney Harbour and started an important conversation about cleaner waterways. The world is rapidly embracing an electric future and the NRMA has a responsibility to help with this transition. We have been leading the charge in regenerative tourism expanding our national footprint of holiday parks, lodges, river and ocean cruising; ensuring safe and equitable access to some of this country’s most extraordinary natural assets. We consciously shifted our tourism focus away from the urban Travelodge hotels to help stimulate regional tourism. From expeditions through the Kimberley, hikes in the Tasmanian wilderness, to holiday parks from Agnes Waters and Airlie Beach in Queensland, to Ballarat in Victoria, we continue to expand our tourism portfolio. The resurgence of drive tourism over the last years has connected us all to the unique experiences and environments regional Australia offers. Our investment arm advanced our strategic objectives, embracing the environment, social and governance principles that underpin our business while still outperforming comparable investment funds. We invested in early stage businesses that were solving emerging problems faced by our Members. These include Sendle which helps with efficient parcel delivery and Elenium, which automates airport check-ins. Important investments such as these reinforce our position as a Member-owned business, one where we can invest and really contribute to a better and more sustainable Australia. We are committed to reconciliation with Australia’s First Peoples evidenced through the employment pathways we are creating and the relationships and partnerships we are building. We are using our unique assets to display and reflect our country’s Indigenous heritage, start conversations and create opportunities to acknowledge the special place Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples hold. We are ambitious. There is much to be done to keep this country we call home and our communities connected. We believe the NRMA has a critical role to play in helping Members and communities build a better and more sustainable future. Driving the right societal change and caring for our Members, customers and communities while retaining the economic strength to accomplish even more is a delicate balance. I am confident that the transformative changes we have made will ensure we are even stronger and more uniquely placed to deliver on our purpose and keep leading the charge on the issues that really matter to our Members. 5 NRMA Annual Report 2022 What an apt theme for the 2022 NRMA Annual Report, leading the charge. The title perfectly encapsulates the year we have had and our vision moving forward. On so many levels the NRMA has played its role as a leadership organisation across mobility and tourism in a year when the nation has faced so much uncertainty. One area of growing national significance has featured heavily in 2022 – the electrification of our road transport. Petrol and diesel vehicles will continue to be the dominant force in Australia’s fleet for years to come. Ensuring our Members have the freedom to choose is crucial to the NRMA, but we only need to look overseas to get a glimpse into Australia’s likely future. In the United Kingdom alone one-in-five new cars sold are electric. Despite significant disruption to the automotive sector globally due to severe supply chain issues, sales of electric vehicles continue to grow in Australia, now representing almost two per cent of all new cars sold nationwide. We continue to build the largest fast charging network in Australia and have now partnered with the Federal Government to grow this network further. The growth of our electric vehicle fleet through SIXT car rentals will help ensure choice on the second-hand market and as government incentives to purchase electric vehicles grow – campaigned for by the NRMA – we expect those sales to increase in the coming years. I am immensely proud of this work and the Board is committed to ensuring we keep leading the charge. The NRMA has also led the charge in our vital role as advocates. Our work has resulted in Government agreeing to deliver an extra 70 rest stop areas nationwide to help combat driver fatigue. I am also very proud of the work we did in partnership with Spinal Cord Injuries Australia, making it easier to find accessible parking through real-time data, thus helping improve the journey for people with disabilities. As we face the worst energy crisis in history with record high oil prices, people have again turned to the NRMA as the guide on what these turbulent times mean for the country, and to ensure motorists are not exposed to higher-than-necessary transport costs. The last 12 months has seen a contrast of trading conditions across our tourism and car rental businesses. The first half of the year was again heavily impacted by COVID-19 with lockdowns and fears over new variants impacting holidays and travel habits. As these factors eased, global supply chain issues and staff shortages made the recovery harder than expected. Pleasingly, our Membership has grown yet again to over 2.77 million Members. This, along with a comparatively positive year in our investment portfolio helped the organisation rally to a net profit after tax of $10.1 million and we are set up for growth this year. Pandemic and extreme weather conditions have also impacted heavily on our roadside operations, placing extraordinary strain on resources as demand for help peaked. Our world- class award-winning team of Patrols and call-centre staff showed the professionalism and agility they are renowned for to rise to the challenge. Over the last year we responded to almost one million breakdowns across NSW and the ACT, including 2,221 children and pets rescued from locked cars. I want to thank our frontline teams for this remarkable work under very difficult conditions. Finally, on behalf of my fellow Directors I want to thank Rohan and his team for another strong year serving our Members and the community, and to you, our Members for your continued support of our mutual. Tim Trumper NRMA Chair A message from our Chair A message from our Group CEO Rohan Lund NRMA Group CEO “We understand and appreciate that our employees are the heart of the NRMA – they make us who we are.” “Despite significant disruption to the automotive sector globally due to severe supply chain issues, sales of electric vehicles continue to grow in Australia, now representing almost two per cent of all new cars sold nationwide.” 7 NRMA Annual Report 2022 NRMA Annual Report 2022 6 About us Motoring and Membership Delivering roadside assistance, services and benefits, driver training, advocacy, electric vehicle fast charging and much more to our 2.77 million Members. We’re Australia’s largest Member-owned organisation and our business has grown well beyond our iconic roadside services. We appreciate and care for this unique environment we call home and are focused on building a sustainable business that affords everyone the opportunity to explore, experience and connect with people and places across Australia. One of Australia’s largest travel, tourism and leisure businesses, providing unique and sustainable experiences for our Members and customers. We continue to grow, inspiring and encouraging people to experience Australia’s unique regions, environments, nature and waterways. NRMA Parks and Resorts 47 owned and managed holiday parks and resorts across Australia, including the iconic Wilpena Pound Resort in South Australia. NRMA Expeditions A suite of unique Tasmanian assets including Cradle Mountain Hotel, Freycinet Lodge, Strahan Village and Gordon River Cruises. We also hold a minority interest in Coral Expeditions. Marine My Fast Ferry commuter services, Fantasea Cruising leisure services, Whale Watching Sydney and Yellow Water Taxis in the Sydney Harbour basin. Vehicle rental Providing vehicle rental services at 160 SIXT locations across Australia. Transport and Tourism A diversified investment portfolio that generates long-term returns. Investments In early 2022, parts of northern NSW and south-east Queensland experienced devastating floods. Unfortunately, natural disasters are not new to this part of the country. From bushfires in 2019-2020 to the Maitland Floods back in 1955, we've always been ready to answer the call when there's help that's needed. So, we did what we do best – we mobilised our staff to help. Two teams of Patrols from Newcastle and Wollongong, volunteered their time to head up to the Northern Rivers region of NSW and lend a hand to our Country Service Centres that were doing it tough. In between trying to save their own businesses and homes, they were also trying to help our Members and the community. So our volunteers came in to help attend to roadside assistance calls, as well as towing and salvaging vehicles inundated or swept away in floodwaters. Paul McNamara, a Field Team Manager in Roadside Delivery headed up the first group of Patrols that waded into the crisis. He said it was a "humbling experience to lead a group of people up there". It wasn't just our Patrols that rolled up their sleeves, our parks and resorts offered displaced families a refuge and our SIXT teams went above and beyond, which you can read about on page 25. Leading the charge Our activities and businesses The year that was The events of the last year have yet again tested our resilience. New variants of COVID-19 emerged, war broke out in Ukraine, global political tensions escalated, and closer to home the La Niña weather event brought devastating floods to the east coast of Australia. In combination with the events of 2020 and 2021, we have all learned that change is constant and resilience is about adapting to new conditions and helping where we can. Top of mind in Australia has been the impact of La Niña which saw record rainfall result in devastating floods across northern NSW and south-east Queensland. The impact of these floods will be felt for years, with towns like Lismore struggling to determine if they will even survive. Livelihoods have been lost, businesses and homes destroyed and our already impacted biodiversity placed under more pressure. The cost of the flooding will run into the billions. The scientific community believes that climate change has led to increased weather related catastrophes. At a global level we are seeing an increased frequency of extreme heat, drought and fires. Australia is at the forefront of these disasters having suffered floods, fire, drought and hail over the last years. These events have focused our, and other businesses' attention on what we can all do to prevent these occurrences and mitigate risks. Businesses like our own are taking steps through the development of environmental processes and policies to reduce our impact and help our Members and communities. These important initiatives are outlined in our report. We have also been there on the ground to help with recovery efforts and are looking at ways where we can mobilise our assets and people even more quickly in times of crisis. Although borders have re-opened and we are welcoming back overseas visitors and venturing abroad ourselves, the pandemic has continued to impact how we live our lives. Across our businesses we are providing the flexibility our Members and customers need in these uncertain times and have retained rigorous COVID-safe practices. One of the effects of the global pandemic has been the impact on supply chains, which has been exacerbated by the outbreak of war in Ukraine and escalating global political tensions. Although Australia is insulated to some degree, we are all feeling the effects of skyrocketing food, energy and oil prices, and some empty shelves. We are also mindful of the negative impacts a war and a pandemic can have on vulnerable and displaced people through human rights violations and are closely monitoring existing and new supply chains. Our NRMA Blue Member benefits program is helping by providing our Members with savings on everyday items such as fuel and insurance and we continue to expand the savings it offers. We recognise that globally, mobility is shifting from combustion engines to electric and are leading the charge through partnering with the Australian Federal government to expand our fast charging network across Australia, providing vital connections. We are helping our Members make this transition by providing them with the information and advice they need, through our Open Road magazine, website and social media. Not only are EVs a cleaner form of transport and therefore have better health and environmental outcomes, vehicle manufacturers driven by emission legislation are also shifting in this direction. Electric is not just limited to personal vehicles, our vehicle rental firm SIXT leads the way in EV rentals and our marine business is operating the first electric ferry service on Sydney Harbour. Change is coming and we are preparing ourselves and our Members for it. As we move into FY23, the last few years have proved how difficult it can be to predict the impact of external events. Lessons we have learned include taking a long term view and remaining flexible enough to pivot when circumstances call for it. Our strategy, our businesses and our people are prepared for a changing future and ready to embrace new sustainable opportunities as they arise. 7 NRMA Annual Report 2022 WHALE WATCHING SYDNEY 9 NRMA Annual Report 2022 8 NRMA Annual Report 2022 Section 1 9 The NRMA Group 10 How we create value 12 Our FY23 Group Strategy 13 Our Environment, Social and Governance priorities 14 Reporting on our performance in FY22 We're working hard to help everyone transition to an electric future by expanding our electric vehicle fast charging network across NSW. This year, we unveiled new ones in Broken Hill, Wilcannia and Cobar. Making journeys in EVs easier The NRMA Group With 2.77 million Members counting on us every day, each decision we make has you at the centre. We are there to help when you need us, and invest in initiatives and businesses that benefit everyone, now and into the future.

Indeed the strategies we devise, our expansion and exploration of new investments remain bound to our core purpose and the values embodied in our brand and represented by our people. While we are cautiously optimistic about the future, we understand the many global challenges that we all face. We continue to provide opportunities for people to explore and connect with Australia’s unique environments through our tourism portfolio, ever aware of the need to conserve the land and water on which we operate. As our portfolio continues to expand we are working with local and Indigenous communities to create unique sustainable experiences that will drive visitation and improve economic health in our regions. We continue to help with the transition to new forms of mobility through our investment in our EV fast charging network, partnership with new mobility leader SIXT and providing information and advice that helps people navigate this change. Although the future remains uncertain we remain confident in our capability and capacity to adapt to meet ever changing circumstances. 2022 presented significant challenges. Due to the Delta variant, domestic borders were closed until November 2021. This crippled the Transport and Tourism segment with significant drops in volume across businesses for the first half of the year. As borders re-opened, we witnessed a surge in demand, and strong trading over the summer holidays. The emergence of the Omicron variant in March 2022 once again disrupted travel and leisure plans and delayed return to offices, resulting in reduced demand for services in our transport and tourism businesses. New weather event challenges such as flooding emerged in the latter part of the year. This forced temporary closures of some holiday parks and vehicle rental sites, disruptions to Marine services and higher than average job volumes in the Motoring and Membership segment, putting pressure on costs. The combination of influenza and COVID infections affected our workforce, requiring use of overtime and recruitment of resources to manage operations and maintain service levels. The Group showed resilience, quickly adapting to the changing conditions and pivoting priorities to maintain services while ensuring the safety and well- being of frontline teams, and mitigating financial impacts on the business. Importantly, the Group continued to invest across all segments to support future growth, with the acquisition of new holiday parks and car rental sites together with a continuation of the roll-out of the EV charging network. Group revenue from contracts with customers and rental income grew to $595.8 million (2021: $527.2 million). This was largely due to acquisition of new holiday parks and the Tasmanian hotel portfolio in the latter half of 2021. In addition we had solid growth in subscriptions from the Group’s new roadside assistance packages, increased battery sales and higher ancillary revenue. The statutory Operating Profit for the year of $22.5 million (2021: $16.6 million) was a good result, delivering a $5.9 million improvement on the prior year despite the operating environment. The result was in part due to strong returns in a volatile market in the Investment portfolio with total returns of 1.6% (2021: 11.8%) compared to benchmark rates of -3.8%. The Group’s statutory Net Profit After Tax in 2022 is $10.1 million (2021: $44.9 million). This includes recognition of unrealised losses from the revaluation of investment portfolio assets that resulted from market volatility in the second half of the year. Equity markets continue to show volatility in light of inflationary pressures and rising interest rates. The Group's financial position is solid with net assets growing to $1,086.0 million (2021: $1,080.2 million), and cash flow is strong with cash flow from operations of $104.9 million (2021: $140.6 million). The outlook for the Group is positive with strong demand across both the Motoring and Membership and Transport and Tourism segments in the last quarter of the year, providing good momentum for 2023.

As the world we live in continues to change, we understand the need to evolve and refresh what Membership means. That's why we're refreshing our Membership design across our businesses to deliver more value, more personalised experiences, and to create opportunities for Members to contribute to their communities directly. - Growth in Members - Improvement in Member experience Transitioning to electric and future mobility As Australia electrifies and de-carbonises, new forms of mobility such as electric vehicles (EVs) and vessels, ride-sharing and vehicle subscription will proliferate, presenting opportunities and challenges. We are working to support our Members with this transition by providing informed advice, advocating for motorists and developing EV related products and services. We are also expanding our EV fast charging network Australia-wide to accelerate the speed of the transition and ensure that regions are not left behind. - Growth in number of EV chargers - Increase in EV charger usage - Increased fleet share of EVs (vehicles and vessels) - Increased share of Members willing to buy an EV Growing our tourism business For over 100 years we’ve kept our Members safe on their journey. Our growing tourism portfolio grants Members the freedom to discover nature, and to connect to people and places across Australia. We continue to expand our portfolio through the acquisition of assets that offer access to unique and iconic environments on land and water, and are investing in improving our guest experience across our sites. - New acquisitions - Growth in visitation - Growth in room yield - Growth in number of sites with signature experience offerings Enhancing our capabilities Our future growth and transformation will require us to supercharge our organisational capability. This includes continuing to develop a high performing workforce with the agility and knowledge necessary to meet future needs, as well as enhancing our digital capacity, systems and brand value across all our businesses. - Employee feedback - Brand NPS, Reptrak scores - Digital touchpoint NPS Embedding environmental and social sustainability From our earliest days, the NRMA has strived to create social value for our Members and community; more important today than ever before.

Over time, we are shifting our investment portfolio towards Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) themed investments. - Return on investment - ESG themed investments % - Liquidity Our FY23 Group Strategy Our Environment, Social and Governance priorities Underpinning our purpose are our Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) principles. These principles inform how we do business – our environmental and social responsibilities, and our corporate governance. As Australia’s largest member- owned organisation, we have both a public and corporate footprint – a position that allows us to bring governments and corporates together to develop new solutions for identified problems. Over the next year our refreshed ESG approach will be embedded across our businesses and ingrained within our culture. Our key ESG themes are outlined below and we will report on our progress against them annually. Our Group Strategy is inspired by the principle of creating ‘shared value’, building a sustainable business that provides value for our Members, customers, and the broader community. Given the ongoing volatility and complexity in the global economy, our strategy aims to remain agile – while setting a general direction for Group businesses to collectively strive towards. Our strategy comprises six pillars: Business value drivers ESG theme Programs SDGs Accelerate the electric transition - Lead the charge on electric vehicles (EVs) Building a connected EV charging network across Australia that gives everyone the confidence to make the transition to an electric vehicle. Lead the charge by electrifying our own vessels and vehicles. - Race to net zero climate impact Setting bold and transparent targets for emissions reduction, rapidly decarbonising our operations and supply chain, and forming partnerships to enable sector-wide change. - Stimulate circular economies in transport and tourism Forming partnerships and adapting our own practices to reduce waste by creating and enhancing, sharing, repairing, reusing and recycling programs. Enrich Australia’s regional communities - Support communities in times of crisis Lending a helping hand and mobilising our Members to help communities in times of crisis and through the deployment of our resources. - Stimulate regional development Supporting regional communities through sustainable tourism development, our regional fast-charging network, and protection of biodiversity to preserve access and foster economic growth. Prioritise people and wellbeing - Accelerate reconciliation Embedding reconciliation across our organisation by deepening cultural awareness, increasing Indigenous employment and procurement, and partnering with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to offer cultural experiences to guests across our parks network. - Enhance safety and wellbeing for our people and communities Continuing to educate and inform Australians on road safety and new mobility, and advocating on their behalf.

For communities and individuals, the NRMA has become synonymous with help during difficult times. Motoring and Membership All things motoring and mobility are at the core of our organisation. Whether that's assisting at the roadside, keeping our children safe through road safety education, helping people navigate the new world of electric vehicles or connecting with regional communities. We're here to help in a powerful way. To understand what people want from their NRMA, we pay attention to what you tell us. This year, we listened to our Members through surveys, interviews and online research, as well as direct feedback through letters, emails and phone calls. We work hard to continuously improve and evolve everything we do – our performance, our brand, our service and our reputation – and it all starts with our Members. This focus earned us the Customer Experience Leader of the Year Award. We continue to support and share our expertise with regional communities through our iconic roadside assistance and partnership with Outback Links, which connects volunteers with people in remote Australia doing it tough. We’ve been there to help during the recent floods and are taking steps to create a sustainable business that conserves our unique environment. We are proud of being awarded Climate Active Certification for the second year in a row, evidence of our commitment to reducing carbon emissions. EVs are core to our strategy and in FY22 we continued to lay the foundation to assist our Members make the transition from today’s petrol and diesel vehicles to electric vehicles. We have plans to develop a range of EV packages that will make it even easier for everyone to make the transition. We also continue to expand our EV fast charging network, providing necessary links across regional and remote areas, making EV journeys even easier. We hope you enjoy reading about our achievements in the coming pages. The Motoring and Membership segment manages a network of service providers to deliver roadside assistance to Members. The segment performed strongly despite the challenges in 2022, with Membership at 2.77 million and growing. Revenue from Motoring and Membership of $322.6 million (2021: $313.1 million) increased on the prior year, with solid growth in subscriptions from the Group’s new roadside assistance packages, and increased battery sales contributing to the result. In addition, ancillary revenue from international driver permits and driver training increased on the back of the gradual re-opening of the economy and borders in the latter half of 2022. Total roadside job volumes were down 1.7%, with COVID restrictions reducing the number of vehicles on the road in the first quarter of the year. However, poor weather and flooding events in the latter half of the year saw higher than average job volumes in the last quarter, across both metro and regional areas. The combination of influenza and COVID infections across the workforce in the second half of the year, provided operational challenges for the business, particularly given the increased job volumes resulting from the wet weather conditions. Overtime was increased to maintain service levels to Members, with priority being given to jobs where safety was an issue. Increased people costs were absorbed by the business. Delivery of high-quality services to Members remained at our core, with the Roadside net promoter score steady at 86 (2021: 86), despite the challenging conditions. We continued to invest in EV infrastructure in 2022 with 12 new chargers installed, bringing the total number of chargers for the Group to 55. This provides 95% coverage over key routes within NSW. The Group has an additional commitment over the coming years to build the national EV backbone infrastructure. The Motoring and Membership segment includes costs that are not core to the provision of services under Membership contracts but core to the running of a mutual organisation. This includes advocacy and corporate overhead costs. The Motoring and Membership segment had an Operating Loss of $1.2 million in 2022 (2021: loss of $3.2 million). In early June 2022, our roadside assistance team received a phone call from Allan, a Member of over 60 years. Unfortunately, Allan had been visiting a relative's grave in Rookwood Cemetery when he bogged his son's car in some soft grass, away from the road. When our Patrols Stuart and Moodi eventually found Allan in the vast and very dark cemetery, Allan said "I don't think you blokes can help me, I'm going to sleep in the car until Monday morning and try and get a tractor to recover me." Well that wasn't going to work for Stuart and Moodi, they replied "We are not leaving until your car is out." After assessing the area, our Patrols managed to safely position the tow truck on a narrow road nearby and put a winch out to Allan's car, with the use of a snatch block to redirect the cable. While Stuart dug mud from the front wheels of Allan's car with a shovel, Moodi set up our specialty recovery equipment. Within an hour, they managed to safely recover Allan's car and tow it across a narrow bridge back to the sealed road. Covered in mud but very relieved, Stuart and Moodi said the effort was all worth it to hear Allan's heartfelt thanks and praise.

In a year that posed many challenges, it’s another example of how the NRMA helps each day. Members saved on everyday things like fuel, energy, insurance, groceries, entertainment, dining, movie tickets and attractions. We also helped them save on bigger things too, including domestic and international travel, vehicle rental and road trips. For Members on the hunt for a new or used car, we partnered with RedBook Inspect to deliver pre-purchase vehicle inspections to provide them with expert advice. This year we partnered with 40 regional cinemas to ensure our regional Members in NSW and the ACT had access to exclusive discounts, as well as adding Hunter Valley Wildlife Park to the program. We opened up a range of unique Indigenous tourism experiences through our partnership with Welcome to Country and continue to expand retail savings including discounts at OPSM, Sunglass Hut and discounts on eGift Cards for over 30 premium brands. We’re always on the hunt for new partners with the right products and services to meet our Members’ needs. Our people We recognise the vital role played by our people and distinct culture in delivering the experience and service our Members expect from the NRMA. With the COVID pandemic continuing to impact how we work, we have improved and promoted the use of our internal online communication network (Yammer). This digital communication channel enabled us to connect, share ideas and maintain our distinct culture despite lockdowns and restrictions. Our efforts and the 25,000 times our people utilised the channel won us a global award for encouraging employee collaboration. As we move into FY23 we are proud of what we have achieved and look forward to providing even more reasons to belong to the NRMA. Members and customers For Members In FY22, after receiving feedback from our Members, we implemented the most important overhaul of our roadside assistance packages in more than a decade. Our new Membership packages deliver greater value and choice for Members and make it easy for them to see the full range of benefits and entitlements they receive as part of their Membership. Feedback from our Members has been overwhelmingly positive. We have continued to invest in the digital experience, keeping our Members informed and connected. We make sure to test mobile app and website innovations with them, incorporating their suggestions and needs. This year we introduced a Track My Patrol function, which allows Members to track the location of their Patrol in real time. Since launch, 246,000 Track My Patrol links have been sent that have resulted in over 260,000 clicks by Members to monitor the status of their roadside booking. Our focus on creating the best digital experience has seen our website and app become synonymous for fast and accurate information. Over the last year, we've had almost 14 million visits to the NRMA website and almost a quarter of a million people followed the NRMA Facebook page. We also increased our Instagram followers by 12% with the popular #whyweroadtrip. Our Members and followers used this hashtag to share their unique road trip stories and photos. Our iconic Open Road magazine grew by 23.7%, becoming the fifth most read magazine in Australia with over 1.24 million readers per issue. Its popularity is illustrative of the fact that it continues to inform and engage our Members. It provides inspiring stories on road trips and unique tourism locations, as well as providing up-to-date motoring information and updates on Member benefits, as well as our plans for the future. For our Members, double demerit points were top of mind this year. The topic attracted the most comments on our Facebook page and our dedicated landing page attracted the most visits. This afforded us the opportunity to highlight key safety measures and remind Members about safe driving over long weekends and during holiday periods. COVID-19 The Board continued to focus on the impact of COVID-19 on employees and managing the provision of services to Members and customers with the large number of employees on sick leave.

We created flood relief teams that delivered power and assistance to those in need and remained on the ground to assist with the clean-up as flood waters receded. In the worst hit areas, our Patrols battled high call volumes and dangerous and demanding conditions to reach stranded drivers and ensure our Members were safe. We thank our Members for being so patient during the longer than normal wait times during the crisis. Our Patrols continued to maintain strict COVID-safe work practices essential with so many people electing to drive to minimise virus exposure. We updated our Enterprise Agreement to provide more employee flexibility and benefits, and incorporated our diversity and inclusion policies to ensure our workforce reflects the diverse society we operate in. Ensuring our Patrols lead in relation to motoring technology, we are soon to trial our first fully electric Patrol van and mobile charging. All our Patrols also receive regular and comprehensive training on vehicle technology to ensure they can get our Members back on the road promptly regardless of vehicle type. We recognise that the transition to electric will take time, so we'll make sure no one is left behind by ensuring our Patrols are across both internal combustion engines and electric. We introduced new digital tablets providing a sustainable technology platform for the future and introduced ‘Track My Patrol’, which gives Members the ability to monitor where their requested Patrol is and when they can be expected. This innovation saves our Members time and is just another way we are looking to make everyone’s lives easier. Our Members have responded enthusiastically to our battery recycling service. Concern over disposal of toxic battery waste resulted in a total of 93.5% of batteries being returned by Members. During the year, 145,031 new batteries were installed, with 135,600 being recycled. Our Australian-based call centres remain the critical point of contact for our Members answering over 1,426,600 calls this year. While many worked from home during lockdowns, we strived to maintain high service levels. These flexible and hybrid work practices and our technology interface are some of the many reasons we retain and attract great people to help our Members. In a year filled with challenges to Member safety, getting you back on the road quickly and safely always remained a priority for our Patrols.

In combination with our driving instruction services, we have delivered the Safer Drivers Course on behalf of Transport for NSW (TfNSW) to over 40,000 participants since its inception in 2013. The Safer Drivers Course is designed to educate young people on how to develop safe driving skills and prepare for solo driving. In addition, we are accredited to deliver the Keys2Drive program and have secured a six month contract to deliver TfNSW’s Helping Learning Drivers Become Safe Drivers (HLDBDS) programs. The Keys2Drive program provides parents teaching children to drive with the practical skills necessary to impart road and driving safety. HLDBDS in northern NSW provides support to parents and driving supervisors of learner drivers. We have also partnered with the Australian Red Cross to deliver the Indigenous Learner Driver Mentor Program, which is designed to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples gain their P1 licence, opening pathways to future training and employment. The program combines driving instruction and supervised driving hours in accordance with P1 requirements. The ongoing pandemic, including lockdowns and safety concerns has again challenged the team who have responded by adjusting operations to suit environmental conditions. This has included the development of engaging online teaching modules that minimised the impact on learning during the pandemic. We have continued to develop our online booking platform and made it easier than ever for Members and customers to reschedule their bookings to align with changing conditions. As we transition to an electric future, we are investing in electric training vehicles that will enable us to deliver dedicated EV training programs and provide the experience necessary to feel comfortable and safe with this new form of mobility. Highlights Business value drivers and SDGs 28 participants successfully completed our Indigenous Learner Driver Mentor Program Booking platform flexibility to cater for changing conditions 21 NRMA Annual Report 2022 Stuart NRMA Patrol “Sometimes roadside assistance isn’t just about helping someone broken down. It’s about doing all you can to help people in vulnerable situations when they have no one else to call.” Our Project Officer, Toni, has been working consistently with 'Cindy’ for a significant length of time as part of our Indigenous Learner Driver Mentor Program. Cindy’s journey to licencing has not just been about driving. Toni and Cindy forged a bond that went beyond being behind the wheel, and as Cindy's confidence grew, it gave her the encouragement she needed to book her test. Having a licence will make an enormous difference to Cindy and her family, as she has an extremely ill husband who needs to get to many medical appointments. Cindy will be able to be more independent. After much support and encouragement, Cindy faced up to the challenge and took the test. Cindy was successful and regained her licence with a near perfect score. Toni said that Cindy was so excited and relieved after her results were given to her, she even teared up, thanking us for all the help and guidance she received during the program. Leading the charge 22 NRMA Annual Report 2022 Our knowledge and experience across the motoring sector gives us an understanding of just how broad the reach of EVs is. Across the world we are already seeing electric cars, buses, utes, trucks and ferries and use is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. With so many options, owning an EV will be open to all our Members, not just those residing in urban areas. Since the launch of our EV fast charging network (the largest in Australia) we have enabled more than 10 million kilometres of EV journeys and more than two million kilowatt hours of renewable energy has been provided. The growing popularity of EVs has seen network demand increase by an additional 21% with more than 50,000 charging sessions delivered. Our research indicates that 51% of EV owners use a public charger at least once a month, demonstrating the importance of a public EV network charging system. To date we have installed more than 55 EV fast charging stations powered by 100% renewable energy. The expansion of our network in partnership with NSW and local governments has been planned to provide the connections and links necessary to enable journeys across NSW and the ACT. Alongside the NSW Government, the recent launch of new chargers across the Barrier Highway in Broken Hill, Wilcannia and Cobar, mean that an EV road trip across one of the most remote arterial routes in NSW is now possible. We worked with local Aboriginal artist Eddie Harris in Wilcannia to wrap our chargers in his artwork, cementing the relationship between Country and community. Eddie’s artwork depicts swimming river fish in the Darling (Baaka) River. We are keen to expand this program incorporating First Nations people’s artwork into our EV fast charging installations. Electric vehicles Highlights Business value drivers and SDGs Partnering with the NSW Government to deliver EV drive days Continuing to be a reliable source of truth on all things EV The transition to electric is a good thing for Australians, which is why we are playing a leadership role through advocacy and investment. We want lower motoring costs, maximised vehicle choice, and better health and environmental outcomes to support future generations. We understand the concerns many motorists have about EV ownership. Charging and charging infrastructure remains of paramount concern. Recognising this, we are partnering with the government to expand our network of chargers across Australia. To help inform Members about EVs, the NRMA has published a growing number of stories and reviews about EVs. Every issue of Open Road has included information, facts, new vehicle reviews and EV road trip stories. Our Members regularly shared their opinions and experiences in the Letters page of the Open Road. We have created a dedicated EV section on our website and continue to publish relevant information and articles online. To make EV ownership even easier, we will soon be launching a new NRMA EV app, and have exciting plans for new EV packages for our Members. We launched an expression of interest for Electric Vehicle Membership bundles to inform our future propositions with 2,000 people registering their interest over a 2 month period. Of the Members surveyed, 50% indicated they would consider an EV when looking to purchase a new vehicle. We are also ensuring our Patrols are trained on the latest EV technology and problems that may arise and can get you back on your way safely. EV drive days Alongside the NSW Government, the NRMA commenced a program aimed at giving Members and the public a taste of what it's like to drive an EV in a safe and friendly environment. There are a lot of unknowns when it comes to EVs and we have found a test drive is the best way to experience what driving and living with an EV is really like. So far, the feedback on the experience is overwhelmingly positive, with participants much more inclined to purchase an EV as their next vehicle. We’re taking this experience to Members and the public right across NSW and the ACT. In addition to driving, attendees can view a range of different EV models, talk to experts about buying, owning and charging EVs, plus be involved in live information sessions with industry experts. These events are free to attend and open to all. More information and updates on the our EV drive days can be found at mynrma.com.au/drive-days Electric vehicles The Board focused on growing the investment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

This year we partnered with the Bear Grylls Survival Academy to bring kids SHIPWRECKED, an action-packed survival and adventure program. Giving you the best guest experience Transport and Tourism We're always seeking new ways to help everyone connect with people and with places, while responding to the needs of our Members, customers and the environment. From our expeditions business and marine services to holiday parks and car rental, we're giving people ways to explore and recharge. The year remained challenging for the tourism industry, with international borders remaining closed for much of the year, and varying state approaches to interstate visitation. Despite this, our commitment to the sector remained, recognising the value Australians place on travel and a holiday as a way of recharging and reconnecting with one another. We continued to expand our holiday parks portfolio, offering Members more locations to holiday domestically, and progressed our refurbishment plans at our destination assets in Tasmania. We also worked with partners identifying future opportunities for the Expeditions business. We successfully transitioned our rental vehicle business from Thrifty to SIXT, building a new culture to deliver an enhanced service experience and continued our ferry operations in Sydney Harbour, at a reduced level, to support commuters. As restrictions eased and consumer confidence returned, Members and Australians sought to explore and rediscover our regions. Working with local operators, we looked to profile and connect travellers to the best of regional and rural Australia. This included partnerships with organisations such as Wildlife Recovery Australia, focused on supporting recovery efforts and conserving our unique flora and fauna that's so vital to the tourism sector. We continue to explore opportunities to connect guests with Indigenous tourism experiences. This has included partnering with the Adnyamathanha people at Wilpena Pound, signing a Memorandum of Understanding with Darkinjung Aboriginal Land Council and consulting with Ochre Rain on the development of our Tasmanian assets. The Transport and Tourism segment manages a portfolio of premium accommodation and leisure assets, including holiday parks, hotels, rental vehicles and Marine vessels, to deliver unique experiences to Members and customers. The Transport and Tourism segment continued to be heavily impacted by COVID-19 restrictions in the first half of 2022. Lockdowns in NSW and Victoria in July 2021 resulted in the closure of domestic borders for much of the first half of the year. Domestic borders reopened from November 2021 as vaccination rates increased leading to a surge in demand over the peak summer holiday period. However, as demand rebounded, outbreaks of the new Omicron variant emerged and quickly spread, disrupting travel and leisure plans and delaying return to offices. In the second half of FY22, the segment faced significant operational challenges with temporary site closures and disruption to services from weather and flooding. Additionally, increased sick leave from both influenza and COVID infections among staff proved challenging, while supply chain constraints and inflation put pressure on costs. The Marine businesses felt the largest impact with a significant drop in passenger numbers in Sydney for most of the year, and higher fuel costs in the second half. Revenue for the segment was $273.6 million in 2022 (2021: $214.5 million). On a like-for-like basis, after adjusting for growth in holiday park and hotel accommodation stock, and the acquisition of new car rental sites, revenue reduced by 6.7%. This is reflective of the disruption to operations during the year. The Operating Loss for the Transport and Tourism segment was $4.2 million in 2022 (2021: operating profit of $2.7 million), with a reduction in Government support through wage subsidy programs, and rent relief in 2022. The demand for transport and tourism services remains strong, with a significant uptick in activity in the tail end of the year and a positive outlook for 2023. We continue to invest in this segment, with the acquisition of two new parks in 2022, Agnes Water and Airlie Beach, bringing the total number of holiday parks to 47. In February 2022, south-east QLD experienced almost three times the month's average rainfall, resulting in tragic flooding. Our SIXT team in south QLD lost 13 cars and four trucks, while our Rocklea office went underwater. Throughout these adverse circumstances, our team led the charge and contacted customers, offering free car hire, removing relocation fees and changing return locations. However, helping our customers wasn't the only thing on our mind. We donated four vehicles to the State Emergency Service (SES) to deliver sandbags across the region. We made trucks and drivers available to the Gold Coast Airport Authority to move donations south into northern NSW and our staff donated items of their own, as well as their time to help with the recovery efforts. Despite our staff and their families experiencing damage to their homes and loss of personal items, everyone rallied together to help each other in the community. And with the support of the NRMA, the staff who were affected were provided with gift cards for fuel and food.

These include extended lockdowns due to the continuation of COVID-19, resulting in subdued commuter patronage, and the La Niña weather event that discouraged locals and visitors from enjoying time on our waterways. We are proud of, and grateful for, the dedication and resilience shown by our frontline teams – on vessels, on wharves and in our customer support areas. They ensure that our focus always remains on securing the safety and comfort of our Members and customers. A testament to this is our staff engagement score which improved by 9 points or 20% on the previous year. In December 2021 My Fast Ferry launched New South Wales’ first fully electric, zero emission commercial ferries. We are committed to leading the way in creating a transport network powered by clean sustainable energy. These two Australian built vessels, Barangaroo and Wallaru, run on 28.8kWh rechargeable batteries that can be fully charged in 2.5 hours, providing 7 hours of operation. We are now commencing investigations into hybrid hydrogen fuel solutions to further reduce emissions on our waterways in the future. There are considerable environmental benefits to electric ferries compared to diesel, saving 40,000 litres of diesel a year and 100 tonnes of CO2 emissions. Plus, they're much quieter. Our commitment to reconciliation with First Nations peoples continued in the last year with ongoing recognition and celebration of NAIDOC Week and National Reconciliation Week, continued support of Babana Aboriginal at several community events including employment expos and mental health awareness days. As well as collaboration with Tribal Warrior around Indigenous recruitment, vessel charters and tourism development, we are also actively seeking a more diverse workforce through our partnership with NOVA Employment in supporting jobseekers with a disability. As we move into the next financial year, we're optimistic that while the pandemic will continue to change the way we live, work and travel, our need for safe and reliable transport options will remain. International borders are reopening, visitors are returning and workers, while continuing to enjoy hybrid work arrangements, will again seek opportunities to reconnect and collaborate in-person. 27 NRMA Annual Report 2022 Expeditions Despite the lingering impacts of COVID and border closures, NRMA Expeditions saw increased visitation across its Tasmanian properties at Freycinet Lodge, Cradle Mountain and Strahan Village, welcoming 127,000 guests in FY22. While visitation to Tasmania is still recovering, those that visited stayed longer and spent more than in FY21. This is a testament to the appeal of Tasmania’s tourism offering and natural environment, and the visitor experience offered across our portfolio. In the last months of trading of FY22, Coral Expeditions saw a return to profitability as COVID restrictions were eased. Coral Expeditions is a bespoke expeditionary cruise company, in which the NRMA made a significant minority investment in FY21. The division also assessed a further 24 acquisition and tourism investment opportunities across the accommodation, marine and nature- based tourism sector, with the ambition of expanding the portfolio nationally. We continue to excel in offering exceptional visitor experiences that celebrate wild places with Gordon River Cruises winning Gold at the National Tourism Awards for Best Tour and Transport Operator. This is the highest industry accolade that can be achieved in the sector. Freycinet Lodge also held its 4.9 out of 5 Average Tripadvisor Bubble Rating for three consecutive months for the year ending FY22. Planning works commenced on our refurbishment activities across the portfolio, despite supply chain disruptions and labour shortages, with prototypes trialed and tested in key locations. FY23 will see significant works commence onsite, creating luxurious havens in the wild, showcasing local character, and transforming the guest experience. As our attention turns to building stronger relationships with the Tasmanian Aboriginal Community, Expeditions partnered with innovative Aboriginal-led enterprise, Ochre-Rain, to understand the story of Aboriginal people across our properties and appropriately acknowledge Country. This will form an integral part of staff training and guest engagement moving forward.

Visitation was impacted by park closures, restrictions on interstate travel, vaccine mandates, labour shortages and unseasonal weather – all resulting in cancelled or postponed trips. NRMA Parks and Resorts' Booking Promise provided our guests with peace of mind enabling them to opt for either a credit or refund if their holiday was impacted by COVID-19. Having memorable holidays with family and friends became even more important for Australian travellers over the last year. We continue to grow our holiday park footprint, with holiday options in Queensland, regional NSW and Victoria. The acquisition of holiday parks at Airlie Beach and Agnes Water, and a new management contract for Batemans Bay after July 2022 will bring the portfolio total to 38 NRMA- branded holiday parks, with Members enjoying benefits of over $2.6 million. We launched new experiences across the portfolio including the hugely successful, Australian exclusive, Bear Grylls Survival Academy for kids (and keen parents), weekly hosted guest events, new giant inflatables and kids’ games, movies under the stars, the Kombi Keg drinks truck and new fleets of e-bikes for exploring the great outdoors. Safety remains paramount for our parks and resorts, so we secured important partnerships to help deliver vital messages to the broader public, Members and guests. These ongoing partnerships include Royal Life Saving Australia for water safety and Tow-ed towing training for expert advice and hands-on tips for towing caravans – very important skills as more people headed out on road trips. We have continued to invest in environmental sustainability across the portfolio including the expansion of our electric vehicle facilities with 39 charging stations now available and high-capacity solar panels now installed at 15 parks. We are proud to announce a national partnership with Camp Quality to provide holidays to kids with cancer and their families, donating much needed funds to the organisation. Additionally, we designed Australia’s first new accessible safari tents for guests with mobility issues. We continue to work alongside First Nations communities, employing more than 50% Indigenous staff at Wilpena Pound Resort in the Flinders Ranges, and signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) at Ocean Beach with the Darkinjung Aboriginal Land Council, enabling us to offer guests cultural tourism experiences that support local Indigenous employment. Highlights Business value drivers and SDGs Launched partnership with Camp Quality – fundraising, accommodation and driving awareness to assist children with cancer Installation of 39 EV chargers and 25 new e-bikes at 5 parks $2.6 million in savings to NRMA Members 50% Indigenous employment at Wilpena Pound Highlights Business value drivers and SDGs Completed the SIXT brand transition maintaining Member service levels, discounts and benefits Increased the SIXT corporate location footprint in south- east Queensland and Northern NSW by 40 locations Leading the vehicle rental market with EV availability Supporting Aboriginal communities through the supply of two vehicles to ID Know yourself In December 2021 we seamlessly transitioned our national vehicle rental business to global mobility leader SIXT. Operating in over 100 countries, SIXT affords customers a range of mobility options including vehicle rental, ride share, ride hailing and vehicle subscription services, all available through the easy to use SIXT app. We are looking forward to offering our Members and customers the full range of SIXT mobility options in the near future. The last year has presented a number of challenges. These included the ongoing effects of COVID-19, which impacted vehicle supply globally and natural disasters locally such as the floods in south-east Queensland and northern NSW. Despite this, our dedicated company-owned and franchised location network continued to go above and beyond to deliver uninterrupted service to Members, leisure, corporate, commercial and wholesale customers across Australia. Throughout this period and despite these issues, we have increased our fleet nationwide, including a range of premium make and model options, and aim to surpass pre-COVID fleet levels by the end of 2023. As one of the largest fleet operators in Australia and conscious of the need to play our part in Australia’s transition to clean energy, we are committed to moving to an electric fleet. We have set ourselves a target to have 50% of our fleet electric by 2027 and continue to work towards achieving this goal. Currently we have electric vehicles available for rent in all major capitals and continue to make them available across new locations. We would encourage all of our Members and customers to try one for themselves and discover just how reliable and easy they are to drive and recharge. As we move into FY23, we acknowledge the work all the SIXT team have put in to ensure we maintain the high levels of customer satisfaction recorded in our net promoter score. 29 NRMA Annual Report 2022 Vehicle rental The Board had oversight of the negotiations and transition of the vehicle rental business to SIXT, which included the acquisition of the business from a franchisee that operated in the South East Queensland and North NSW. Board focus area To support our ESG Strategy, NRMA Parks and Resorts have been hard at work. We installed solar street lighting at 10 parks, pool blankets at parks in Victoria, introduced 25 e-bikes and transitioned from paper-based registration forms to digital, reducing over one million pieces of paper per annum. We also installed an accessibility ramp at Treasure Island and established two new accessible cabins at Portland and Eastern Beach, ensuring that everyone can enjoy a holiday there. To help with the tragic flooding, we provided short-term accommodation to people who were temporarily displaced, as well as allocating Dubbo Holiday Park to NSW Health for quarantine purposes over four months. These are just a few examples of how we're contributing socially, environmentally and in the interests of our Members and customers. In the coming year we'll continue what we've started and look for new initiatives to help support the organisation's focus on ESG. Leading the charge We're invested in exploring not just electrification on land, but also on water. Our electric- powered shuttle that transports people from Pyrmont Bay to King Street Wharf on Sydney Harbour has been going strong for over a year now. A more sustainable way to explore 31 NRMA Annual Report 2022 30 NRMA Annual Report 2022 Section 4 31 Investments Highlights Business value drivers and SDGs Outstripped the market with 1.6% total return on core portfolio Increased investment in ESG funds Investments The Investments segment manages a diversified portfolio of assets to support the short-term income and liquidity needs of the Group, while also delivering longer term capital growth for reinvestment. To achieve this, the allocation of assets in the portfolio is balanced across risk and defensive assets including equities, property, infrastructure, fixed income and cash assets in accordance with the Group's Investment Policy Statement (IPS). 2022 was a mixed year for equity markets. Markets trended up in the first half of the year on the back of low interest rates, while the war in Ukraine, inflationary pressure and rising interest rates rattled markets in the second half of the financial year, resulting in elevated market volatility. Overall, the Australian equity market was down 6.5%. Despite this, the total returns delivered by the core portfolio of 1.6% (2021: 11.8%), outperformed similar strategy investments such as balanced superfunds, which delivered -3.8% for the year. Over the longer term, the core portfolio has delivered strong returns at 6.7% and 9.6% per annum over five and ten years respectively. The total returns of the 2022 portfolio are inclusive of $22.0 million in net unrealised losses from fair value adjustments (2021: net unrealised gains of $48.4 million) with equity markets sharply declining in June 2022. Shortly after the end of the financial year, these unrealised losses were more than recouped, with strong performance in markets delivering unrealised gains of $54.4 million by the end of August. Markets continue to be volatile and the outlook remains challenging. Investments delivering positive environmental, social and governance (ESG) outcomes are an important component of the segments portfolio, and the Group continues to explore opportunities to expand investments in this space. During the year, investments were made in two new ESG funds, one focused on investing for environmental and social impact and one focused on agriculture and food technology promoting regional Australia, while providing a positive environmental impact. We also continue to hold other social infrastructure investments. The Investments segment also includes our joint venture and associate investments. This included the Group's investment in a portfolio of hotels through Australia (operating under the Travelodge brand). These assets were classified as a discontinued operation in 2021, following an agreement for sale. Settlement of all but one property in the portfolio occurred in 2022 with settlement on the remaining property anticipated to occur in the first half of 2023. The Operating Profit for the Investments segment for 2022 is $27.9 million (2021: $17.1 million). The increase in Operating Profit is primarily due to an increase in dividends in 2022, with many fund managers distributing gains from their realised positions throughout the year. Our portfolio is diversified across a wide variety of asset classes including equities, property, infrastructure, private equity, fixed income and cash assets. Travelodge The Board had oversight of the negotiations of the divestment of the Travelodge portfolio of hotels jointly owned with Mirvac. Investment Portfolio The Board had oversight of asset allocation in the investment portfolio and regularly reviewed performance.

We take pride in being an organisation that supports people for who they are and continue to work to ensure everyone feels comfortable being their true selves. Everyone’s welcome at work Underpinning the value we created Natural disasters and extreme weather events have focused everyone’s attention on the need to protect our natural environment. Across our businesses we’re intent on implementing systems and innovations that minimise our impact and have refreshed and embedded ESG targets across our businesses. We are partnering with organisations such as Wildlife Recovery Australia to play our part in halting biodiversity loss and setting targets with respect to emissions. We remain committed to supporting regional Australia through the expansion of our EV fast charging network, highlighting unique environments through our tourism assets and supporting regional communities through programs such as Outback Links. We continue to work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples through our Reconciliation Action Plan and have actively sought to develop and promote Indigenous tourism experiences across our businesses. The commitments we as an organisation hold are embodied within our culture and the people we employ. Our people’s commitment to helping, volunteering in times of crisis and going the extra mile at every opportunity is one of the many things that makes us proud. The following pages outline our achievements and activities over the last year. Everything we do is because of our commitment to our Members, communities, conservation of our natural environment and building a more sustainable future for all Australians. Whether it’s investing in our EV fast charging network to assist with the transition to cleaner mobility, helping in times of crisis or supporting communities through our partnerships and programs, we continue to work towards a better future. Here in Australia, we’re lucky enough to have diverse wildlife and many animals that aren’t found anywhere else in the world. To keep our precious fauna safe near roads we’ve teamed up with Wildlife Recovery Australia (WRA). A joint venture of Byron Bay Wildlife Hospital (BBWH) and Odonata Foundation. Our partnership exists to help fund critical programs that rescue, treat, rehabilitate and release native animals, and conserve biodiversity. As part of this partnership, drivers can purchase a veterinary-endorsed Wildlife Rescue Kit to use if they encounter injured wildlife, particularly if they're found near the roadside. The kits include practical tools, safety guidelines for helping native animals and information about the IFAW Wildlife Rescue App to locate your closest veterinary hospital or wildlife rescue. In July, CEO of BBWH Stephen Van Mil was travelling to sister organisation, the Raptor Recovery Australia to transport Pancake the Peregrine Falcon to their rehabilitation aviaries. On the way, he came across a severely injured female wombat with head trauma and a baby still in her pouch. Unfortunately the mother passed away, but thanks to his Wildlife Rescue Kit, Dr. Van Mil was able to save the joey and transport him to care. Now named Kenny, the baby wombat is doing well in care and has been a joy to look after. We are all tracking his progress.

In order to achieve this, we are developing strategies and initiatives that reduce the environmental impacts of our operations and by leading the charge, engaging communities and Members on transport electrification. We are also embarking on a program to assist our Members in understanding how they can reduce their own impacts and contribute to a sustainable Australia. Our focus areas include transitioning to an electric future, protecting and contributing to biodiversity, and addressing how in our assets and operations we can reduce our own carbon footprint and impact on the environment. Transitioning to an electric future Fossil fuels have limited reserves and produce pollution and greenhouse gases (GHG), which contribute directly to climate change and cause environmental harm. EVs produce less GHG emissions and other pollutants in comparison to internal combustion vehicles improving air quality and our natural environment. The transition to EVs by our Members and the community will enable power to be drawn from non-polluting renewable sources, directly benefiting our environment. To support this transition, we have invested in Australia’s largest fast charging network across regional ACT and NSW. We have also invested in Electric Highway Tasmania, which currently has six chargers and is expanding their network to meet demand. We are also partnering with the Australian Government to expand the EV fast charging network across the country and continue to expand the NSW network in partnership with the NSW Government. In addition, we are installing chargers across NRMA Parks and Resorts, enabling our Members and guests to holiday in their EV and are planning to install chargers across the SIXT network. Our My Fast Ferry business has commenced its electric transition through the conversion of the Barangaroo to Pyrmont shuttle from diesel to electric. Operational environmental impacts One of our largest direct impacts is our GHG pollution. Our emissions are reported under the federal NGER scheme and for FY21 were 26,150tCO2e, with 239,492GJ of energy consumed. The Scope 1 and 2 emissions are listed in this table. FY21 emissions NRMA Group Scope 1 direct (fuel based) 11,921tCO2e Scope 2 indirect (electricity) 14,229tCO2e (The GHG emissions for FY22 are being prepared concurrently with this Annual Report and will be included in next year’s Annual Report.) The emissions from each source and business unit are shown below. Only the 2 months for which the NRMA owned Freycinet Lodge, Cradle Mountain Hotel, Strahan Village and Gordon River Cruises are included. We will also estimate our broader Scope 3 (supply chain) emissions and have started to consider the risks a changing climate will have on our operations. To reduce our own environmental impact, Motoring and Membership operations were certified as carbon neutral for a second year through the Federal Government’s Climate Active program. The certification acknowledges the work Motoring and Membership has undertaken to reduce GHG emissions and the remaining emissions are offset through carbon credits. In addition to international carbon credits, we purchased Australian biodiversity credits from the WatchBox Road Biodiversity Project located in central Victoria to help protect Grassy and Healthy Dry Forest, which is home to the endangered Brush-tailed Phascogale. Partnering to conserve wildlife and increase biodiversity Recognising the critical role of biodiversity in sustaining life on our planet, we have announced a two year partnership with Wildlife Recovery Australia (WRA). WRA is a joint venture between the Odonata Foundation and Byron Bay Wildlife Hospital. They're undertaking vital work in saving our unique wildlife, reversing climate change and increasing biodiversity. None of us will forget the fires of late 2019 and early 2020, where an estimated three billion animals died and thousands of hectares of land, including critical ecosystems were destroyed. Now, with the recent flooding across NSW thousands more will die or face habitat loss. Our work with the Odanata Foundation will enable us to develop a richer understanding of vital ecosystems across our tourism assets and we will work together with them to create wildlife sanctuaries and unique ecotourism experiences for our Members and guests. Through our support of Byron Bay Wildlife Hospital whose mobile wildlife hospital, Matilda can be deployed to disaster areas and their Wildlife Rescue Kits for personal use, it is our belief that we can have a positive impact on preserving our unique wildlife and ecosystems. Environment The Board continued to monitor the impact from extreme weather events on not only our business performance but also on the Members and communities affected and, assisting people where possible. Board focus area Byron Bay Wildlife Hospital's mobile wildlife hospital Our GHG emissions sources GHG emissions in FY21 were down for the 2nd consecutive year, largely due to reduced activity during the pandemic. Fuel for the ferry fleet is a major emissions source and the reduced services during the pandemic lockdowns reduced emissions from fuel. Electricity consumption and its associated emissions from our offices also decreased during the lockdowns. We will lower our GHG emissions in the near term through energy efficiency programs and in the longer term by converting the electricity supply to renewable sources, changing vehicles over to electric as suitable models become available and converting gas based heating appliances to electric. 35 NRMA Annual Report 2022 36 NRMA Annual Report 2022 Our Policy and Advocacy team worked closely with government, industry and community stakeholders in FY22 to progress a range of short and long term initiatives for Members. With natural disasters continuing to impact economic conditions and key transport assets, we prioritised work on regional roads, driver safety and cost of living. Our work in these areas led to significant upgrade and maintenance works on local roads, the implementation of new road safety policies, and the expansion of our fuel transparency tool that gives motorists the opportunity to easily search for the lowest cost fuel within their Local Government Area. To improve road conditions and transport sustainability, the implementation of our policy on road reclassifications was progressed, alongside investment of more than $3.5 billion in the road network across NSW and the ACT. To improve road network user equity and funding sustainability over the short and long term, our views on toll roads in Sydney and road pricing – how we fund, finance and charge for roads – were presented to governments to support continuing reviews and reforms. As the transition to EVs continues, we partnered with the NSW Government to progress a public education campaign, and announced an initiative to deliver more than 20 public EV drive days to enable Members to experience what it’s like to drive an EV. More information and updates on our EV drive days can be found at mynrma.com.au/drive-days To support road trips and regional connectivity, we continued to advocate for equitable access to EV charging infrastructure nationwide, leading to a commitment alongside the Australian Government to deliver more than 100 new EV fast charging sites nationally. We also progressed policies with government and industry aimed at encouraging greater supply of EVs to the Australian market, and we are seeing promising signs in this regard. Our relentless work with stakeholders on road safety in FY22 led to meaningful policy change, new road safety plans, and billions of dollars in targeted investment to support safer driving, riding and vulnerable road users. We also continued our work on reform options across land-use planning, transport modelling, park- and-ride infrastructure investment and technology utilisation aimed at improving the transparency, provision and efficiency of parking, including for those living with a disability. Digital parking upgrades with new technology to make it easier to find and access disabled parking spaces across Sydney are now being progressed. 37 NRMA Annual Report 2022 Once again we faced a year full of challenges. One that tested our resolve and impacted so many. Torrential rainfall and flooding on the east coast, dangerous fire conditions in the west and a pandemic that shows no sign of ending. Throughout it all we have done what we always do, roll up our sleeves and looked for ways to help. The flooding on the east coast this year devastated communities. Who can forget the images of homes and businesses inundated with flood water and roads that resembled rivers? When the crisis hit, our business sprang into action. We mobilised our Patrols, our people and our vehicle rental business, SIXT to help. Battling difficult conditions, our Patrols headed to the Northern Rivers region of NSW to assist with stranded vehicles, moving people to safety and staying to assist with the clean-up. In south-east Queensland the SIXT team provided the SES vehicles and made truck drivers available to the Gold Coast Airport Authority to assist with transporting donated goods. NRMA Parks and Resorts offered accommodation to people whose homes were destroyed and are planning a mattress donation to help people rebuild their lives. In times like these we want to do more and have formed a group taskforce to help us mobilise our assets no matter the disaster, to provide those affected with the support they need. Through our partnership with Frontier Services we continue to help farmers through our Outback Links program. The program enables volunteers from across the NRMA Group including our mechanics, to provide much needed free assistance to farmers. This year our volunteer teams headed to Parkes in March and Condobolin in May. They repaired and rebuilt critical farm equipment, vehicles and bikes and also helped paint houses, clean, clear sheds and even assisted with hooking up the internet. These programs not only benefit the people we help but also have a lasting positive impact on our people. Great relationships and friendships are formed and the stories and photos they bring back are an inspiration to us all. We are thrilled that despite a COVID impacted year, our Indigenous Learner Driver Mentor Program in partnership with the Australian Red Cross saw 15 participants in Nowra and 11 in Wagga Wagga gain their P1 licence. The program provides participants with expert driving instruction and driving experience to meet licence hour targets. The gaining of a P1 licence has a significant impact on participants, opening up employment opportunities and giving people the ability to undertake further training not available in their immediate area. As a group we continue to look for ways to help people, our Members and communities across Australia. The challenges of the last few years have highlighted how important it is to work together in times of crisis and the need to build a better future. Advocacy The Board continued to prioritise advocating for improvements to road safety for all users, in particular, focusing on renewing the NSW Road Safety Plan and combatting driver distraction. As a result, government investment is supporting better data use, improved detection practices, renewed infrastructure and new awareness programs.

We believe that by working in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people we can help heal the scars of the past, ensure equality of opportunity and move forward to a brighter shared future for all Australians. Over the last five years we have been on a journey to learn, appreciate and understand how our organisation can best contribute to reconciliation through our Reconciliation Action Plans. These plans set out the initiatives and actions our organisation will take to contribute to reconciliation. Our current Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) ends in July 2022, and despite the pandemic impacting some of our planned actions we are proud of what we have achieved. Of the many highlights this year perhaps the most significant was the appointment of our Indigenous Engagement Manager, Di Ellis. Di’s connections with Indigenous communities across Australia, approachability and generosity in imparting her knowledge and experience has resulted in renewed excitement and engagement with our RAP across our businesses. Di took advantage of online channels to program a series of Lunch and Learn workshops that gave all our people the opportunity to hear from Di herself, Elders and community representatives on Indigenous history, language and culture. In addition Di led our group wide Reconciliation Week activity bringing our people together to reflect on the meaning of reconciliation through the creation of individual artworks. During NAIDOC Week we partnered with OzHarvest and Nathon Lyons of Kooking with a Koori fame, bringing together a representative from each business to collaboratively cook a dish using fabulous native ingredients. Seventy lunches were prepared and served at the Redfern Community Centre. The core focus areas of our Stretch RAP include employment, the creation of employment pathways, and supporting the development of Indigenous owned businesses and Indigenous tourism. Over the last 12 months we have continued to promote Indigenous tourism experiences to our Members and reached out to local Indigenous communities to develop relationships and open up opportunities. NRMA Parks and Resorts have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Darkinjung Land Council, enabling our Ocean Beach guests to experience unique Indigenous cultural experiences and continue to work with the Adnyamathanha people on the development of the iconic Wilpena Pound Resort in South Australia. Although employment was impacted by the downturn in the tourism industry, it remains a focus and we are working with CareerTrackers to identify and place Indigenous students across our businesses. Our existing partnerships with the Adnyamathanha people, Darkinjung Land Council, Tribal Warrior in Sydney and community relationships across Australia remain central to our employment strategy. We have continued to partner with the Australian Red Cross on the Indigenous Learner Driver Mentor Program, which provides vehicles, driving instruction and the support necessary to gain a P1 licence, opening pathways to employment and further education. Our SIXT business is supporting Aboriginal mentoring organisation ID Know Yourself by providing vehicles and moving assistance to Aboriginal children who are in, or leaving foster care. We continue to actively seek to employ, mentor and retain Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across our businesses and continue to refine our Indigenous employment strategy. Under Di’s stewardship we are working to formulate our new Stretch RAP and align our activities with our businesses to maximise our impact. Reconciliation Action Plan Meet our new Indigenous Engagement Manager Di Ellis is a proud Aboriginal woman from her father’s Country Wiradjuri. Brought up in Peak Hill in Kinship and loved and cared for by her Aunties, Uncles and cousins galore. Di also identifies as Torres Strait Islander as her mother’s father was born on Badu Island. Di is a mother of 3 and grandmother to 3 gorgeous grandchildren who all live in the central west of NSW. Di graduated from Peak Hill Central School in 1990. Di's love for her culture is infectious. She has been a passionate advocate for reconciliation working with corporates, and government alike to lead their reconciliation journey. Respected by communities across Australia, Di is an inspirational mentor and leader to our people. About Bianca Gardiner-Dodd Meet Kamilaroi woman Bianca Gardiner- Dodd, the Contemporary Australian Aboriginal Artist who has created our RAP artwork. Her work reflects the coastal environment and surrounding elements of the landscapes she was raised and continues to live in. Bianca's work is symbolic of her interpretation of her coastal life, exploring a variety of environments such as estuaries, forests and beaches, drawing upon the organic harmony and unity of life that exists within. Born in 1978, Bianca spent her early years in the Western Suburbs of Sydney on Dharug Country before moving to the Tweed coast as a young child. She now resides in the coastal village of Pottsville Beach on the Far North Coast of NSW, Bundjalung Country.

We also strive for best practice and timely solutions to support current business activities and strategic initiatives. In FY22 we continued to manage the rapidly shifting health guidelines related to COVID-19, doing everything possible to keep our people, Members and customers safe and healthy. This meant thinking flexibly and being innovative in the way we managed the risks presented while providing services to our Members, customers and guests. As our business diversifies, the need to have an accessible and multi-faceted safety system solution is paramount. This year we launched several new modules within our safety technology platform including risk and contractor management modules. These additional modules enable the NRMA to more effectively manage workplace health and safety risks at a business and site level and informs our risk control practices in enterprise risk registers. As we continue to refine our safety management system, we commenced preparation for ISO 4501 certification by undertaking a detailed gap analysis of our current system. The opportunities for improvement have been implemented and phase 1 certification is in scope for FY23. Our program of innovation and support in the area of injury prevention and management has seen a further reduction in Loss Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) and Serious Injury Frequency Rate (SIFR) across the Group resulting in targets met for both key metrics. Serious Risk Observations (SRO) continue to be a valuable lead indicator, which enables our Senior Leaders to promote a Just Safety Culture by having meaningful conversations about risks that could cause serious injury, and make changes swiftly if an opportunity for improvement is identified. Importantly, our SRO scope broadened this year to include conversations about Environmental risks as well as Safety and Security Risks. The mental and physical wellbeing of our people continues to be a major focus. This year we launched a partnership with Sonder Safe, made the 28bySam fitness app available to all our people and further developed our Mental Health Peer Support program. These initiatives provide support and resources for our people, including exercise and nutrition options, medical advice, counselling services and physical security options for when our people are travelling or working alone. Highlights Business value drivers and SDGs Reduced lost time injuries by 50%, resulting in a total of 7 The NRMA continued to champion road safety awareness in FY22 delivering a series of education programs designed to help keep some of our most vulnerable road users safe. With lockdowns impacting the first half of the year, we developed online road safety programs that reached a total of 18,678 school students and 196 primary and secondary schools across NSW and the ACT. When lockdown restrictions were lifted, we re-started our face-to-face primary school Science & Road Safety program in February. We visited 91 schools and educated 40,225 students across a 6 month period. At the same time, the relaunch of high school in person programs resulted in visits to 25 schools and 112 workshops for 2,500 students. Responding to a pattern of children playing on or near roads during lockdown periods, NRMA Driver Training also delivered a program to primary school students, focusing on the dangers of playing near traffic. More than 12,000 students from 109 schools participated. During the peak of lockdown, we continued to participate in the Youth Eco Summit. In partnership with the Sydney Olympic Park Authority, we delivered five live webinars centered on the Future of Transport. We successfully reached 4,500 students across NSW and the ACT. In our annual Future of Transport Challenge, we invited students to show us what a more socially, economically and environmentally sustainable future would look like. Our aim is to encourage the next generation of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) leaders to start planning for the next era of mobility. The challenge attracted 41 submissions and reached more than 700 students from years 7-10.

We also introduced our senior leadership program Lead for the Future. We’ve had 191 leaders participate in our leadership programs during the FY22 year and 338 since the commencement of the program in 2020. In our most recent employee Your Voice survey, our leadership score of 80% is tangible evidence of the way our leaders enable and support our people to be the best they can be. Future focus As we look to implement our 2023-2025 people strategy, we will build on what we have achieved in 2020-2022, with a particular focus on supercharging our capabilities. We will continue to identify required capabilities for our future and build them through targeted development initiatives. We’re investing in our technology and people systems to ensure we have quality data and to support the sustainability and success of our business through improved employee and customer experiences. Gender Male Female Population 47.3% 52.7% Executive 62.5% 37.5% Senior leadership 49% 51% Board performance and diversity The Board completed an independent review of its performance, its skills matrix and diversity and agreed to review progress against the agreed action during FY23. Talent retention The Board monitored the retention of talent and the improvements to the employee value proposition to attract talent due to the skills shortage in particular industries. People and Culture The Board continued to monitor the implementation of the plan to embed the desired culture of the NRMA during FY22, which included a focus on leadership, embedding leadership capabilities, introducing a senior leadership program and building a more structured approach to assessing and developing senior talent. Board focus area “We have been focused on creating a workplace that is truly supportive and inclusive, where everyone is treated fairly and belongs. The last couple of years have demonstrated the importance of flexible work practices, and the many benefits that this approach has for not only our employees but also our Members and our organisation as a whole. I am committed to ensuring the NRMA is a place where everyone, irrespective of gender, carer responsibilities, background or lived experience are given equal opportunity to achieve their goals and make meaningful contributions.” Rohan Lund Group CEO To continue to promote a level playing field for all and to promote a Family Inclusive Workplace, we have removed secondary carer from our parental leave policy to recognise the role of all care givers in the initial years of a child’s life. Our Video Production Manager Vinny told us he's grateful he works for an employer who values the benefits that can be enjoyed by either parent taking parental leave. It meant he was able to spend quality time with his son at a crucial stage in his early development and it also allowed his wife to return to work and continue her professional journey. 43 NRMA Annual Report 2022 At the end of 2021, we launched a report with Spinal Cord Injuries Australia (SCIA) to improve accessible parking in NSW, titled 'Where do I park?' Our report called for long overdue improvements to reduce barriers for people with a disability to access mobility parking spaces. Susan Wood from SCIA shared her experience as a driver with disabilities saying, "...going out, no matter what disability the driver has, requires planning." After a lot of hard work from our advocacy team and SCIA, we're happy to share the NSW Government has announced the roll- out of real time data for accessible parking spots. 3,600 sensors will be introduced across the state so people can see in real time where and when accessible parking spots are available. Leading the charge 45 NRMA Annual Report 2022 44 NRMA Annual Report 2022 After leading customer experience in the car rental industry – something SIXT has already achieved on a global scale – we introduced the brand to Australia. With ambitions of being the number one mobility partner in the country and driving change for a clean future, we’re making electric vehicles a growing part of the fleet for everyone to experience and enjoy. Experiencing a different way to road trip The overall objective of our risk management approach is to drive innovation and opportunities that help achieve our strategy and purpose, while aligning to our risk culture. Our approach to risk management Risk management is everyone’s responsibility at the NRMA and we enable this through our Risk Management system which has been developed in accordance with ISO/ AS 31000: 2018 – Risk Management. It aims to influence our culture to better manage risk and opportunities. As a consequence of the easing of restrictions and international borders re- opening, there is a level of stability in the business. However, there are ongoing and constantly changing impacts to operations as a result of the natural catastrophic events witnessed by Australians in the past financial year. Across our operations, the NRMA has been focused on the prevention or management of the impacts of floods, storms, bushfires, COVID-19 and cyber security and data governance risks. The prevention and management of these risks are regularly discussed at the Executive and Board level. We also have a co-ordinated group approach to manage crisis or business continuity incidents where they arise, consisting of executives and operational representatives from each business unit. We aligned our COVID-19 approach with Government and Health advice and the Board was regularly updated and informed of any major impacts and decisions. Risk Operating Model We've adopted a robust and fit for purpose risk operating model to deliver on our strategic priorities. Over the last 12 months, the NRMA has seen some key changes from both internal decisions and external factors. As a result, the model was reviewed during FY22 to improve its operating effectiveness in a decentralised structure. Section 6 45 Our approach to risk management 48 Strategic risk management 1 Strong governance 2 Defined appetite 3 Positive culture Risk and compliance enablers help build the risk and compliance management capability across the business through training and education, application of common tools and techniques, and increased use of data and information. 5a Design: common process 5b Implementation: simple tools and techniques 6 Evaluation: aligned data and reporting Leadership and commitment are risk and compliance pillars. They establish the foundation for risk and compliance management. This includes clearly articulating risk and compliance governance, risk appetite and risk and compliance culture and alignment. They align with business direction, strategy, objectives and organisational policy. Risk integration allows key risks and obligations to be identified, evaluated and assessed, and key decisions to be made as a natural part of the business operations in a manner appropriate for the Executive and divisions (including projects). 4 Executive Corporate Member/customer divisions Continuous improvement 7 47 NRMA Annual Report 2022 46 NRMA Annual Report 2022 Risk management approach The Board is updated at every Board meeting on the status of risk management. This approach helps us benefit from opportunities while mitigating anticipated risks. The NRMA management team provides either a full or critical risk review to the Board’s Audit and Risk Management Committee (ARMC). The timing of these risk reviews is aligned with the strategy development plans of each division and overall group to identify: • Risks to achieving the strategy, and; • Actions required to mitigate or manage the risks within the Risk Appetite to include in the business plan and budget – or to identify areas that exceed the Risk Appetite. Risks are assessed on their control effectiveness, likelihood and their consequences. Consequence is assessed on the basis of impact to reputation, financial impairment, compliance, operating ability, people and culture and effect on our Members and wider community. These reviews provide confidence to the ARMC that our business managers are effectively identifying and managing risks to a level that they consider tolerable, or have plans in progress to bring it within tolerance. Compliance The NRMA conducts its operations to comply with relevant legislative and regulatory requirements using a prudent governance approach which identifies, manages, monitors and reports our compliance obligations and compliance performance for our key compliance risk areas. Our internal policies and procedures and our employee training program support this compliance approach. Group Compliance is responsible for monitoring and reporting our compliance approach for key compliance risk areas and escalating notifiable incidents to our Board. Compliance Coordinators (our subject matter experts) are allocated for each of these areas and are responsible for ensuring that policies and procedures are implemented and support the frontline teams to manage and monitor their compliance obligations. Notifiable incidents are reported monthly to our Board through the CEO report, a formal quarterly report is provided to the ARMC. This is consolidated into an annual report provided to the Board on the compliance landscape. Internal audit The internal audit function is carried out by Group Internal Audit and is independent of the external auditor. The General Manager of Risk, Compliance and Audit has a direct reporting line to the chair of the ARMC. The ARMC approves the Internal Audit Charter and the internal audit plan. The internal audit plan is prepared on an agile basis. The original IA Plan is based on the current business strategy and operating environment, using a risk based approach, while also including three year rolling critical financial and IT controls audits. The Group Internal Audit team then regularly review proposed audits based on specific strategic considerations or risk areas that have been identified by management and the Internal Audit team with proposed changes approved by the ARMC. The objectives of the Internal Audit Plan are to provide independent and objective insights and confidence to the ARMC over the management of key risks through effective controls, systems and processes to achieve strategic objectives. Informed Balanced Conservative Zero tolerance Strategic Financial Operational Compliance People Risk appetite, risk management and mitigation. The Board supported and continued to monitor the implementation of the Risk and Compliance Operating Rhythm Project during FY22, which focused on uplifting the risk and compliance maturity of staff at the business unit level by increasing capability and clarifying accountability. Board focus area Risk appetite and positive risk culture Our risk appetite sets its direction for risk management and informs strategic options and decisions whilst supporting strategy execution, the delivery of the business objectives and our positive risk culture. The NRMA Group Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) is a dynamic, directional document that evolves in line with our strategic direction and: • articulates consistent, simply defined minimum standards or ‘guard rails’ to support timely, autonomous decision making at the right level; • identifies areas we have zero appetite for, while also defining what we have appetite for to support staff opportunities to achieve our strategy; • promotes the discussion of risk and increases the capability of our people to inherently consider risk (increasing risk culture maturity); • is the basis of all our Group Policies which are supported through frameworks or processes to maximise control effectiveness and efficiencies. Our Risk Appetite Statement is reviewed annually to align with any changes in accordance with the Board’s strategic and business plan expectations. The NRMA Risk Appetite Statement focuses on five strategic risk categories that align with the material issues to our strategic delivery and key stakeholders including Members, partners, suppliers, thought leaders and customers. Framework Our risk culture is integrated with our culture and our Playbook. Ongoing risk discussions are held with our Board, ARMC, Executive team and general managers to build our RAS into the way we work, our stakeholder discussions and relationships.

An external experienced expert governance advisory firm (External Provider) conducted a Board Performance Review during the first half of FY22. Their independent assessment of the Board’s performance found the Board was performing well, which aligned to both the Board’s self-assessment and the Executive team’s rating of the Board’s performance. The Board’s achievements and strengths, as well as, incremental improvements to lift Board performance identified by the External Provider, included: Achievements - Withstood the challenges of bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic well, with a reinforced sense of purpose - Maintained a strategic focus even while dealing with day to day COVID-19 pressures - Valuable annual strategy session - Increased the strategic focus of the Committees to better meet the Board’s operational oversight needs Strengths - Effective Directors with diverse experience and backgrounds - Mutually respectful and open to different perspectives - Deep commitment to the NRMA and delivering value to Members - Shared desire to contribute and make a positive difference - Effective trust-based relationship with Management - Rigorous governance processes - Welcoming environment for new Directors and Executives Lifting Performance - Maintain a constructive tension, by the Board increasing its constructive challenging of each other and the Executive team - Increase the active shaping of the strategic direction, by the Board increasing its frequency during the year of reflection on and discussion with management to refresh the strategic direction of the NRMA - Modify Committees' contributions at Board meetings, by the Board receiving not just the outcomes at Committee meetings but through the Committee Chairs providing additional insights from the Committee’s discussions The Board discussed the results of their Board Performance Review and agreed an action plan of incremental improvements to lift its performance. The Board also agreed it would review its progress during FY23. Skills and experience of Directors – Board Skills Matrix The Board periodically reviews its matrix of skills and experience with reference to the NRMA strategic direction in order to make the best decisions on behalf of Members, and this responsibility is led by GCNC. The External Provider also conducted the review of the Board Skills Matrix, where they used an approach that increased the consistency between Directors’ answers and the overall objectivity of the self-assessments. For each of the 17 categories of skills and experience there were several questions on skill, capability or experience that was in total 90 questions. For each question, Directors selected which of four levels most closely described their level of capability. The four levels of capability were, Expert, Advanced, Capable and Limited and were based on the number of years of experience as a senior executive or director of the NRMA or a comparable organisation: The External Provider found that: - collectively the Board has a good mix of skills and experience that cover most areas necessary for high performance boards and recognise the current and future needs of the NRMA; - there was scope to deepen the Board’s experience in the sectors where the NRMA currently operates and where it is considering increasing its presence, including motoring, the transport sector, energy or clean transport, and to a lesser extent, the tourism and leisure industry; - the Board has limited levels of skills and experience in Data and Cyber Security and Systems and Technology Infrastructure, although in both cases one Director has strong capabilities and experience. It was noted that not all Directors are expected to be strong in all categories, with different Directors contributing different skills and experiences, and levels of capabilities, to the Board. The Board discussed the outcome of the review of its collective mix of skills and experience and agreed that the Board skills matrix would be used: - to reflect on whether the Board would obtain external expertise as part of its deliberations and decision making; and - in the recruitment of Appointed Director or casual vacancies as they arise and where possible in the election process of Member-elected Directors. Board Skills Matrix Significant changes Board succession Board composition The Board comprises six Member- elected Directors and up to three Directors appointed by the Board (Appointed Directors). This ensures the Board has the necessary blend of skills, experience and knowledge to successfully deliver on the strategy and other key functions, while still enabling Members to elect the majority of Directors. Board succession occurs through retirement and Member elections every four years, Board appointed Directors for a term of up to four years, and appointment where casual vacancies arise. The last election of the six Member-elected Directors was held in 2019. The next scheduled election is to be held in 2023. Each Director can serve on the Board for a maximum of 12 years. During the year, Board succession planning was a matter the Board considered. Director retirements and Appointed Director re-appointments There have been no retirements of Directors or Board re-appointments of Appointed Directors during the year. Board skills, experience, knowledge and continuing education The Board aims to ensure that it has a range of skills, experience and knowledge. This range provides the foundations for the Board to effectively fulfil its role, in particular provide strategic direction, grow the business and manage risks and emerging threats, and therefore create value for Members. The Board has various ways in which it manages the skills, experience and knowledge of Directors, both individually and collectively as a Board. Role of the Board The strategy, culture, performance, corporate governance and risk appetite of the NRMA is the responsibility of, and managed under the direction of, the Board of Directors (Board). The Board also has responsibility for appointing the Appointed Directors and Group CEO, and for reviewing its own, the Group CEO's and the direct reports’ performance. Governance This section provides an overview of the NRMA corporate governance structure and includes a review of changes and key activities carried out by the Board and Committees during the year. Additional corporate governance information about the NRMA, the Board, Committees, charters, Directors’ fees, the election and appointment of Directors, as well as copies of prior Annual Reports, can be found at mynrma.com.au/board Our corporate governance structure facilitates the continued creation of value for Members by delivering strategic outcomes through sensible risk taking. We do this primarily by ensuring that the accountability and control systems are commensurate with the risks involved. The Board continued to encourage Member participation in the governance of the NRMA through the Annual General Meeting (AGM). Since 2017, the NRMA has been holding hybrid AGMs. However, due to the extraordinary circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and for the continued safety of everyone in our community, the 2021 AGM was held virtually with Members able to participate and ask questions in writing or verbally in real time. Members were also afforded the opportunity to submit questions in advance, and popular questions were addressed by the Chair and Group CEO at the meeting. Key functions of the Board The Board undertakes several key functions. - confirming the strategic direction of the NRMA to create value for Members: An annual Board strategy offsite is held and the strategic direction and priorities are confirmed at the Board meeting following the offsite. - setting the risk appetite to guide decision-making by our people. The Board, with support from the Audit and Risk Management Committee (ARMC) review the risk appetite statement annually, and management communicates the Board-approved statement to senior leaders to guide their decision-making. - confirming the values and behaviours of how the NRMA expects its people to conduct themselves: The Board periodically approves the code of conduct, desired culture and the Inclusion, Diversity and Belonging Strategy and is supported by the Governance, Compensation and Nomination Committee (GCNC), through GCNC’s monitoring of management’s implementation and embedding with our people. - monitoring the organisation’s culture in line with the values, behaviours and risk appetite: The Board monitors the culture, with support from GCNC and ARMC, through culture survey results, monitoring the implementation of culture initiatives, and reviewing incidents raised including from the speak up hotline. Metrics for culture, for example leadership or engagement, are included on the NRMA Group Scorecard, with annual targets set. - ensuring an effective governance structure with appropriate controls in place: The Board monitors key controls mainly through internal audits that are reported to ARMC and their enquiry of management. Committees of the Board As at 1 July 2022 the Committees with delegated authority from the Board set out on page 56-58, continued to exist to assist the Board to perform its functions and the membership of each Committee was last reviewed by the Board on 9 December 2019.

Each Director who has not attended the course before joining must do so within two years of the date of their election or appointment. All Directors are in compliance with this constitutional requirement. Board continuing education Directors are encouraged and assisted to attend educational courses that enhance their performance as a Director on the Board. An annual allocation of funding is provided to support these activities. Additionally, the Board or Committees are briefed on emerging trends and developments across the industries in which the NRMA businesses operate. The Board also obtains expertise and advice in other ways it determines necessary from time-to-time, including obtaining external advice from experts. The list of topics below were all provided to Directors by external speakers who are subject matter experts. Financial Capital Assets During the period the: - FIC received economic briefings providing a market update and outlook from its asset manager, to inform oversight of the Core Investment Portfolio given the continued economic uncertainty arising from global and local events; - FIC received briefings from its asset manager on ESG investment strategies and responsible investment policies, to inform the drafting of our Responsible Investment Policy; - Board received a briefing on the global learnings on electric vehicle charging infrastructure and services, and on car manufacturers and; - their transition to electric vehicles, supporting the Board’s review of the strategic direction of transitioning to electric and the future of mobility. Members and Customers Reputation and Community Board heard from a panel of Members and customers on what it means to be a Member, how they would like to be recognised as a Member and what role they want the NRMA to play in the community, supporting the Board’s review of the strategic direction to grow Membership. People and Culture During the period the: - Board received a briefing on how companies compete in ‘The Great Reshuffle’, to better understand and support the Group CEO and Executive team in remaining agile in retaining and attracting talented people and maintaining the humanistic culture of the NRMA, so it had the skills and experience to continue to execute on its strategy; - ARMC received a short summary on the information released to the public on the Star casino inquiry and it agreed that when the report was released it would be discussed by ARMC for continuous learning. Environment Board received briefings on the Australian energy landscape, the role of energy storage in supporting renewable energy transition, the electrification of transport and the community economic abundance through zero emission electrification, the future of mobility and global usage of electric vehicles. This supports the Board’s review of the organisation’s strategic direction and its investment in the electric vehicle fast charging network infrastructure. Governance framework Constitution review The review of the Constitution was completed during the year with the Board approving a revised constitution to be proposed to Members for their consideration and approval at the 2022 Annual General Meeting. The two key changes in the proposal are the introduction of staggered elections, so that not all six Member-elected Directors stand for election at the same time, and a candidates’ skills assessment as part of the Director election process. Integrated reporting approach The Board acknowledges responsibility for the Annual Report, which is prepared with reference to the International Integrated framework (for integrated reporting), now owned by the IFRS Foundation. A working group of Directors provided guidance and feedback to management on the report, including the key messaging and readability for Members, over the course of three meetings. Each year the Annual Report is reviewed and approved by the Board. Board diversity As an additional component to the Board Skills Matrix, the External Provider conducted their assessment of the Board’s diversity, which the Board can use to reflect on and discuss whether it has the diversity needed to optimise its decision making. The External Provider’s Board Diversity Assessment covered demographic diversity, cognitive diversity, experiential diversity, and personality diversity. The assessment involved Directors identifying where they saw themselves and each of their colleagues typically sitting between two equally valid end points, as well as providing information on gender, age and, cultural background and identity. The External Provider found that the Board’s diversity, has: - very good gender representation with more than 50% of Directors female; - a good mix between Directors who generally focus on the detail of decisions and performance, and Directors who take a ‘big picture’ view; - a good mix between Directors who use facts, metrics and hard evidence to assess performance and Directors who use the mood in the organisation, the Board’s dynamic with Management, and external sentiment; - a good spread between challengers and conciliators, with some weighting towards a conciliatory approach - a weighting towards those Directors who are likely to drive change over those who believe in sticking with what has been shown to work; - limited age and cultural diversity. Overall, the Directors’ self-assessment ratings were mostly close to the average ratings given by their peers, which suggests a high degree of self-awareness in the Board and in each Director. The Board discussed the results of the review of its diversity assessment and agreed that it provided good insights to reflect on and be aware of when it is considering matters and making decisions.

Papers for Board and Committee meetings are prepared by senior management and circulated electronically to Directors prior to the meetings, allowing time to familiarise themselves with the content.

The NRMA Group strategy, business plans and individual objectives we set each year guide us in delivering our performance. Executive remuneration Given the external market pressures, we are obsessed in ensuring our remuneration approach enables us to attract, motivate and retain amazing people to deliver outstanding value for our Members and customers. We ensure that our competitive reward practices for executive and senior management remuneration are designed to encourage and compensate performance and behaviours that are consistent with our Playbook. Directors’ remuneration Under the Constitution, the Directors’ fee pool for the conduct of ordinary services is subject to review at 1 January each year following any year in which no increase to the Directors’ fee pool has been approved by Members at a general meeting. The Directors’ fee pool for the conduct of ordinary services excludes Committee fees and superannuation payments. The Constitution sets out that in the year a review of the Directors' fee pool is undertaken, the increase in the fee pool is the ‘percentage CPI change’. The ‘percentage CPI change’ is defined as the percentage change between the September quarter before the 1 January review and the September quarter in the year prior, for the All Groups Consumer Price Index for the weighted average of eight capital cities as published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Board must pass a resolution to determine the Board fees for Directors, but the total amount of fees must not exceed the Directors’ fee pool. The Board must also pass a resolution to determine the fees for those Directors who are members of a Committee. The Board obtains independent external advice as required from time to time to assist with determining Board and Committee fees. The Board has determined that Board fees and Committee fees will increase in line with any CPI increase of the Directors’ fee pool. The Chair and Deputy Chair do not receive fees for being members of a Committee or attending Committee meetings. Superannuation is paid by the NRMA on behalf of the Directors at the rate of 13 per cent. As an increase in the Directors' fee pool was not proposed to Members at the 2021 AGM, on 1 January 2022 the Directors' fee pool was increased by the percentage CPI change of 3%. The Board fees and Committee fees paid to each Director is available on the NRMA website: mynrma.com.au/committees Key Management Personnel (KMP) remuneration The table below relates to the NRMA Group as an aggregate of Directors and Executives remuneration (for the years ended 30 June 2022 and 2021) being the key management personnel (KMP). KMP are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity. For the year ended 30 June 2022, salary and incentive payments across the NRMA Group were reduced as part of the impacts of COVID-19. The design of our remuneration strategy is to ensure that the reward outcomes for our people are directly linked to the NRMA Group strategy. This incorporates a balanced approach that considers the expectations of our key stakeholders, aligning market competitive remuneration outcomes that deliver strong individual performance and behaviours that align to our Playbook, supporting us to motivate, retain and attract outstanding people to our organisation. 2022 $ 2021 $ Short term employment benefits $5,483,650 5,469,082 Post-employment benefits $254,185 242,334 Other long-term employment benefits $990,764 994,046 Total $6,728,599 6,705,462 Consolidated Executive Leadership Team Executive Leadership Team Vivian Miles* Executive General Manager Strategy and Investments Vivian was appointed to the role of Executive General Manager, Strategy and Investments in June 2021.

(iii) New standards, interpretation and amendments The Group applied for the first-time certain standards and amendments, which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, including Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2: Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16, and Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021 Amendments to IFRS 16. These did not have a material impact to the Group on adoption. The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. On consolidation, the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the following applicable exchange rates: The Group has consistently applied all accounting policies to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. Other significant accounting policies are contained in the notes to the financial statements. (i) Basis of consolidation The Financial Report incorporates the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Group and its subsidiaries. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The Financial Report includes the information and results of each subsidiary from the date on which the Company obtains control and until such time as the Company ceases to control such entity. In preparing the Financial Report, all intercompany balances and transactions, and unrealised profits arising within the consolidated entity, are eliminated in full. Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Financial Position, respectively. Investments in subsidiaries held by the Company are accounted for at cost in the separate financial statements of the Parent entity less any impaired charges. Where indicators of impairment exist, to the extent that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised. (ii) Foreign currency Transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Australian dollars at the reporting date using the following applicable exchange rates: A5. Summary of significant accounting policies Foreign currency amount Applicable exchange rate Transactions Date of transaction Monetary assets and liabilities Reporting date Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value Date fair value is determined Foreign currency amount Applicable exchange rate Income and expenses Average exchange rate Assets and liabilities Reporting date Equity Historical date Reserves Reporting date B Business performance This section provides the information that is most relevant to understanding the financial performance of the Group during the year-end, where relevant, the accounting policies applied, and the critical judgements and estimates made. An operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision-maker to effectively allocate Group resources and assess performance. The Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports reviewed and used by the Group CEO to assess performance and determine the allocation of resources. The consolidated entity operates in Australia. The operating segments are identified by the Group based on the nature of the services provided. Discrete financial information about each of these operating businesses is reported to the Group CEO on a recurring basis. The reportable segments are based on a combination of operating segments determined by the similarity of the services provided and the sources of the Group’s major risks that could therefore have the greatest effect on the rates of return. The Group has determined that reportable segments are best represented as service lines. The reportable segments identified within the Group are outlined below: Service line Segment description Motoring and Membership Provision of road assistance and other services to Members and customers. The Motoring and Membership segment includes costs that are not core to the provision of services under Membership contracts but core to the running of a mutual organisation, including advocacy and corporate overheads. Transport and Tourism Generates revenue from contracts with customers for ferry services, holiday park and hotel accommodation, and income from vehicle rental. Investments Derives income from the Group’s portfolio of investments, including investments in associates and joint ventures. B1. Segment information B1. Segment information B2.

In addition, this also includes the provision of payroll services for holiday parks managed contract arrangements. (v) Rental income Lease income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. (vi) Interest income Revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant period using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. (vii) Dividend income Revenue is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established. (viii) Property income Income from letting investment properties is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent income from letting is recognised as income in the periods in which it is earned. Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income. (b) Contract balances Opening and closing balances of trade receivables and contract liabilities arising from contracts with customers are disclosed separately. Refer to notes C2 and C9. 81 80 NRMA Annual Report 2022 NRMA Annual Report 2022 B3. Expenses Finance costs Finance costs arise due to the defined benefit obligation and the impact of the unwinding of discounted provisions, such as the restoration obligation and contingent consideration, as the settlement date of the expected future obligation draws nearer. Borrowing costs and finance charges payable under finance lease and hire purchase contracts are also included in finance costs.

The franking credits represent income tax already paid by entities within the investment portfolio. In addition, the NRMA is a Mutual organisation and, as such, derives income and incurs costs in its transactions with Members as owners of the company. These transactions with Members are not subject to company income tax. (i) Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount of income taxes payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or tax loss for the period. It is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. (ii) Offsetting deferred tax balances Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, and the Company/Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, where there is a legally enforceable right to offset. (iii) Tax consolidation The Company and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries are part of a tax-consolidated group under Australian taxation law. National Roads and Motorists’ Association Limited is the head entity of the tax-consolidated group. Tax expense/income, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences of the members of the tax-consolidated group are recognised in the separate financial statements of the members of the tax-consolidated group using the group allocation approach. Current tax liabilities and assets and deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and tax credits of the members of the tax-consolidated group are recognised by the Company (as the head entity in the tax-consolidated group). Tax contribution amounts payable to or receivable by the Company are recognised in accordance with the Group’s tax funding arrangements. To the extent the tax contribution amounts determined under the tax funding arrangement differ from the current tax liability or asset assumed by the Company in respect of a particular entity, the difference is recognised as a contribution from (or distribution to) equity participants. (iv) Franking account balance The amount of franking credits available at 30 June 2022 are $334.1 million (2021: $320.7 million), and the balance is calculated using the corporate tax rate of 30% (2021: 30%). The balance of the franking account arises from franked income received and income tax paid. The Company’s Constitution prevents the payment of dividends, and accordingly, the franking credits are not utilised. (v) Carried forward tax losses The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset (2021: Nil) with respect to its carried forward tax losses. 85 84 NRMA Annual Report 2022 NRMA Annual Report 2022 C Operating assets and liabilities This section provides information relating to the operating assets and liabilities of the Group.

Reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities continued (a) Recognition and measurement Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash is held as part of the investment strategy. For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities on the statement of financial position. Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents represents fair value. Short-term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months, depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the representative short-term deposit rates. 87 86 NRMA Annual Report 2022 NRMA Annual Report 2022 (i) Other receivables These include prepayments and other receivables incurred under normal terms and conditions and which do not earn interest. None of these balances is considered to be past due or impaired. (ii) Fair value Due to the short term nature of these receivables, their carrying amount is assumed to approximate their fair value. (c) Calculation of expected credit loss (ECL) In determining the ECL for the group, NRMA uses historical customer information, adjusted for known forward looking conditions such as the revenue forecast for each business unit and the general economic outlook. With the deterioration in trading conditions resulting from COVID-19, a further layer of profiling was completed to add further robustness to the calculation of the provision. In particular: - Specific industry risk and impacts were assessed and customers segmented on that basis; - Intensive profiling of historical payment patterns of customers and likelihood of default; - Assessment of recent changes in pattern or method of settling debts, for instance, requests for payment plans or use of credit card facilities; and - Specific provisions were raised for debts considered to be bad. (a) Recognition and measurement Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value, less an allowance for uncollectible amounts and expected credit losses. Trade receivables are non-interest bearing. The recoverability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Debts that are known to be uncollectible are written off when identified. Financial difficulties of the debtor, default payments or debts more than 91 days overdue are considered objective evidence of impairment. The amount of impairment loss is the receivable carrying amount. At the reporting date, trade receivables of $1,863,000 (2021: $1,684,000) were past due and considered impaired.

Such cost includes the cost of replacing parts that are eligible for capitalisation when the cost of replacing the parts is incurred. Similarly, when each major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement only if it is eligible for capitalisation. All other repairs and maintenance are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: The assets' residual values, useful lives and amortisation methods are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each reporting date. For detail on the approach to testing for impairment, refer to note C9. C4.

Intangible assets and goodwill *Transfer of Land use rights to classify as a right-of-use asset under AASB 16 Leases. C5. Right-of-use assets continued (a) Recognition and measurement The Group recognises a right-of-use asset at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment and other carrying value losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. See note C9 Impairment of Assets and carrying value adjustments for further details. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases of machinery that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets, including IT equipment. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with the leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The expense relating to payments not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities is as follows. 2022 $000 2021 $000 Short-term leases 4,221 3,433 Leases of low value assets 173 202 Variable lease payments 23,429 23,155 Total 27,823 26,790 Recognise as an operating expense over the term of the service contract • Fee for the use of application software Recognise as an operating expense as the service is received • Configurations costs • Data conversion and migration costs • Testing costs • Training costs (iii) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) arrangements SaaS arrangements are service contracts providing the NRMA Group with the right to access the cloud provider’s application software over the contract period. As such, the NRMA Group does not receive a software intangible asset at the contract commencement date. A right to receive future access to the supplier’s software does not, at the contract commencement date, give the customer the power to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the software itself and to restrict others’ access to those benefits. The following outlines the accounting treatment of costs incurred in relation to SaaS arrangements: Costs incurred for the development of software code that enhances or modifies or creates additional capability to existing on-premise systems and meets the definition of and recognition criteria for an intangible asset are recognised as intangible software assets. (iv) Amortisation Where applicable, amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated finite life of the intangible assets as follows: - Licence agreements - over the life of the licence - Software - over 3 to 10 years - Contracts - over 8 to 45 years C6. Intangible assets and goodwill continued (a) Recognition and measurement (i) Goodwill Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. If this consideration is less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in the profit or loss as a bargain purchase. (ii) Research and development The Group is undertaking a number of development projects aimed at producing new products and services, along with the ongoing investment in information technology systems. Expenditure on research into areas such as potential new products and services is recognised as an expense as incurred. An intangible asset arising from development expenditure on an internal project is recognised only when the Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, the availability of resources to complete the development and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure, the cost model is applied, requiring the asset to be carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Any expenditure so capitalised is amortised over the period of expected benefit from the related project. Given the significant investment, there is an element of judgment regarding the recoverability of the asset values and in the classification of expenditure as capital rather than ongoing operational in nature. 95 94 NRMA Annual Report 2022 NRMA Annual Report 2022 The following table sets out the maturity analysis of lease liabilities for leases, showing the undiscounted lease payments to be paid after the reporting date. Future cash outflows to which the lessee is potentially exposed that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities includes exposure arising from: - variable lease payments; - extension options and termination options; - residual value guarantees; and - leases not yet commenced to which the lessee is committed. C7. Lease liabilities The Group applied the practical expedient for rent concessions received as a consequence of COVID-19. These concessions met the following criteria: - the revised consideration was substantially the same or less than the original consideration; Land $000 Buildings $000 Motor vehicles $000 Total $000 Year ended 30 June 2022 At 1 July 2021 101,222 158,865 1,112 261,199 Additions 32,087 50,400 2 82,489 Liabilities held for sale - - - - Acquisition of businesses - - - - Repayments (6,822) (25,213) (288) (32,323) Payouts - - (829) (829) Lease modifications - 52,225 - 52,225 Interest 4,133 7,045 3 11,180 Foreign exchange differences - - - - At 30 June 2022 130,620 243,322 - 373,942 Current 6,016 14,116 - 20,132 Non-current 124,604 229,206 - 353,810 Less than one year 8,063 22,407 - 30,470 One to five year 30,515 77,216 - 107,731 More than five years 175,357 228,658 - 404,015 Total undiscounted lease liabilities 213,935 328,281 - 542,216 Year ended 30 June 2021 At 1 July 2020 80,267 191,066 3,067 274,400 Additions 3,610 2,736 87 6,433 Liabilities held for sale - (9,666) - (9,666) Acquisition of businesses 21,671 1,862 - 23,533 Repayments (7,492) (31,774) (917) (40,183) Payouts - (63) (1,167) (1,230) Lease modifications - (745) (2) (747) Interest 3,166 5,497 45 8,708 Foreign exchange differences - (48) (1) (49) At 30 June 2021 101,222 158,865 1,112 261,199 Current 4,564 18,525 848 23,937 Non-current 96,658 140,340 264 237,262 Less than one year 7,807 25,394 866 34,067 One to five year 25,347 73,735 267 99,349 More than five years 131,529 99,302 - 230,831 Total undiscounted lease liabilities 164,683 198,431 1,133 364,247 Rent concessions due to COVID-19 C7. Lease liabilities continued C8. Finance lease receivable The following table sets out a maturity analysis of finance lease receivables, showing the undiscounted lease payments to be received after the reporting date. The Group has a number of sub-lease agreements in place with rental franchisees for property rentals. As the lessor, the sub-lease arrangements have been classified as a finance lease as substantially all the risk and rewards of the underlying asset are transferred. Property rentals are currently under operating head leases. The assets are sub-let to franchisees on back-to-back agreements, passing on the same terms and conditions in the lease agreement with the lessor to the franchisee. (a) Recognition and measurement When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset. When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interest in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease. If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group applies AASB 15 to allocate the consideration in the contract. The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term as part of ‘other income’. Finance lease receivables 2022 $000 2021 $000 Within one year 20 2,313 One to five years 51 3,234 More than five years 8 20 Total undiscounted lease payment receivables 79 5,567 Unearned finance income (6) (173) Net investment in the lease 73 5,394 Current 18 2,218 Non-current 55 3,176 Total finance lease receivables 73 5,394 - the reduction in lease payments relates to payments due on or before 30 June 2022; and - no other substantive changes have been made to the terms of the lease. As a result, concessions of $4.3 million for continued operations (2021: $8.3 million) and $0.6 million for discontinued operations (2021: $1.1 million) were recognised in the profit or loss account as a credit against lease expense and not accounted for as lease modifications. (a) Recognition and measurement The Group recognises a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: - fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; - amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and - the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate and are not, in substance, fixed, such as those based on performance or usage of the underlying asset, are not included as lease payments. Instead, they are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the event that triggers the payment occurs. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The likely duration of leases is assessed based on available information. Where options to extend a lease are available, an assessment of the likelihood of exercising the option is made based on relevant facts and economic incentives. Extension assumptions are also made, in some instances, on leases that have expired and moved to month-to-month arrangements. The assumptions are based on the criticality of the site to the operation of the business, and the general industry practice of long-term month-to-month contracts at these locations. 97 96 NRMA Annual Report 2022 NRMA Annual Report 2022 C9. Impairment and carrying value 		 adjustment of assets Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and carrying value adjustments, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. The carrying value of an intangible asset arising from development expenditure is tested for impairment annually whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable (or when the asset is not yet available for use, annually or more frequently when an indication of impairment arises during the reporting period). Equity accounted investments are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment (or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired). The recoverable amount of the asset is determined as the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. If it is not possible to determine a recoverable amount for the individual assets, the assets are assessed together in the smallest group of assets which generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets (CGUs). Goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised as an expense in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (v) Impairment loss and carrying value adjustments Key estimate and judgement: impairment of assets Determination of potential impairment requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of the CGUs to which the goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are allocated. In 2022, the Group used the “value in use method” (2021: “value in use method”) to determine the recoverable amount. A valuation methodology based on a discounted cashflow (DCF) analysis was completed, using inputs including estimated maintainable operating profit applying mutual tax rates and an appropriate discount rate and growth rate. 2022 $000 2021 $000 Year ended 30 June Unrealised fair value changes recognised in profit or loss - note D7 - (4,410) Goodwill - 16,095 Plant and equipment - 3 Right-of-use (reversal of impairment) (6,195) 8,036 Discontinued operations – note C3 6,195 (8,039) Total impairment and carrying value adjustments - 11,685 C9. Impairment and carrying value adjustment of assets continued The following table summarises the quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in measuring the recoverable value of the CGU’s. The discount rate is calculated at the weighted average cost of capital utilising the capital asset pricing mechanism. These value in use assessments, based on the above inputs, support the carrying value of goodwill associated with these CGU’s at 30 June 2022. Goodwill arising from the acquisition of newly acquired parks and vehicle rental franchises has not been impairment tested given the proximity of the acquisition to year end, its value approximating value in use. Impact of possible changes in key assumptions Reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions outlined above, could potentially cause the carrying value of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount, and result in an impairment. These are: i. an increase of WACC discount rate and/or decrease in growth rate of 1%; and ii. the ability to deliver capital programs as planned, given current supply chain constraints, to achieve growth targets. Reversal of impairment loss In 2021 NRMA impaired all right-of-use assets relating to NRMA New Zealand. In 2022 the group successfully novated the leases to NZ Leisure Ltd, generating a benefit that triggered the reversal of impairment taken in the prior year.

Unearned income Unearned revenue comprises of amounts received from Members for entrance fees and roadside subscriptions, prepayments for ferry and tourism related services, and deposits on holiday park accommodation. For Member entrance fees and roadside subscriptions, the earned portion of amounts received is recognised as revenue evenly over the subscription period using the 365 day method (earned over one year). Revenue received applicable to the unexpired period of the subscription term is recognised as unearned income. Amounts received in respect of prepaid ferry and tourism related services and deposits for holiday park and hotel accommodation are recognised as revenue as the customer utilises the service. Revenue received in respect of services yet to be provided is recognised as unearned income. 99 98 NRMA Annual Report 2022 NRMA Annual Report 2022 D Financial instruments The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, which include: market risk (mainly price risk as the Group has minimal exposure to interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk which are not material), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall financial risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. The Group uses different methods to measure different types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods include sensitivity analysis in the case of interest rate, foreign exchange and other price risks and ageing analysis for credit and liquidity risk. Financial risk management is carried out by the Chief Financial Office (CFO) team under policies approved by the Board of Directors (the Board). The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investment of excess liquidity. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board, which provide written principles on the use of financial instruments and other derivatives. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the internal auditors on a continuing basis. The Parent is not exposed to any significant financial risk. Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in Section D to the financial statements. Market risk (i) Interest rate risk The Group’s interest rate risk is minimal. Interest rate risk arises from floating rate borrowings and capped bank loan facilities. It also has third party borrowings in the form of finance leases. Further details of the Group’s interest bearing liabilities are provided in note D6. (ii) Foreign exchange risk While the Group transacts in a range of currencies and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the New Zealand Dollar, this exposure is minimal as the Group’s volume of overseas transactions is low. The Group does not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. (iii) Price risk The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk. This arises from investments held by the Group and classified in the statement of financial position as other non-current financial assets. The investment balance is comprised of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Group’s investment in financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are in IAG shares that are publicly traded on the Australian Stock Exchange. In addition, the group also carry investments in a few startup companies that are not publicly listed. The Group’s intention is to hold these financial assets to collect contractual cash flows or sell financial assets to maximise the return on the portfolio until the need arises for the invested cash. In the absence of public trading, the acquisition costs of these shares will be treated as a proxy for its fair value. There has been no market decline in value based on recent capital raising with investors apart from the NRMA. D1.

Financial risk management objectives and policies continued The table below analyses the Group’s other investments into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the reporting date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows: 101 100 NRMA Annual Report 2022 NRMA Annual Report 2022 (a) Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. Credit risk is managed on a business unit basis. No business unit has a significant concentration of credit risk. Each business unit has policies in place to ensure that sales of products and services are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying amount of each class of receivable mentioned above. The Group does not hold any guarantees over the debts of customers. For information on the ageing profile and impairment of trade receivables refer to note C2(b). (b) Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, the Group aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve on the basis of expected cash flow. The table opposite analyses the Group’s financial liabilities, financial guarantees and net settled derivative financial instruments into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the reporting date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows: Where the counterparty has a choice of when the amount is paid, the liability is allocated to the earliest period in which the Group can be required to pay. When the Group is committed to make amounts available in instalments, each instalment is allocated to the earliest period in which the Group is required to pay. For financial guarantee contracts, the maximum amount of the guarantee is allocated to the earliest period in which the guarantee can be called. Leasing obligations, trade payables and other financial liabilities mainly originate from the financing of assets used in the Group’s ongoing operations such as property, plant, equipment and investments in working capital (e.g. inventories and trade receivables). Liquid non-derivative assets comprising cash and receivables are considered in the Group’s overall liquidity risk. The Group ensures that sufficient liquid assets are available to meet all the required short-term cash payments. D1.

Level 2 The fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included in Level that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices). Level 3 The fair value is estimated using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. The fair value of financial instruments as well as the methods used to estimate the fair value are summarised in the table below: D2.

There were no transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 for recurring fair value measurements during the year. (i) Valuation techniques used to determine Level 1 and Level 2 fair values The total value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1 Financial instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices, dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs are classified within level 2. These include unlisted unit trusts valued at the redemption value per unit, as reported by the managers of such trusts. (ii) Valuation techniques and processes used to determine Level 3 fair values The Group engages external, independent and qualified valuers to determine the fair value of its land and buildings classified as an investment property at least every three years.

Expected vacancy rate - - * The valuation methods used in 2022 were capitalisation of net income and direct comparison methods. In 2021, a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach was used to value the properties. D3. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (a) Recognition and measurement The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: - Financial assets at amortised cost - Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition depending on the purpose for which the investments were acquired or originated. The classification is determined by the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in the profit or loss as they arise (FVTPL), unless a more restrictive criteria is met for classifying and measuring the assets at either amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Assets carried at amortised cost Subsequent to initial recognition, receivables with less than 12 months maturity are classified and measured at amortised cost. (i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss The Group has classified certain financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Fair value is determined in the manner described in note D2. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in the statement of profit or loss. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such on the basis that this group of financial assets are managed and performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information about the portfolio is provided internally on this basis to the Group’s key management personnel.

The carrying amount includes the cost of replacing part of an existing investment property at the time that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met, and excludes the costs of day-to-day servicing of an investment property. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at fair value (refer to note D2 (ii)), which reflects market conditions at the reporting date. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment properties are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they arise. In the event of a change in use of assets from operating assets to investment assets, the asset is revalued to its fair value with the difference between the carrying value and fair value accounted in the asset revaluation reserve. (b) Amounts recognised in the statement of profit or loss for investment properties D4. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (a) Recognition and measurement The Group has elected to hold certain equity instruments that are not actively traded at fair value through other comprehensive income. Future valuation changes will not flow through profit or loss but instead will be accounted for in other comprehensive income. 2022 $000 2021 $000 Listed investments 48,166 60,150 Unlisted investments 18,691 12,650 At 30 June 66,857 72,800 D6.

After initial recognition, interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities that are yield related are included as part of the carrying amount of the loans and interest bearing liabilities. Interest bearing liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. (b) Assets held as security During 2022 the Group refinanced the revolving cash advance facility. The facility was increased from $250 million to $300 million with $75 million on a five year term and $225 million on a three year maturity. Under the new facility all wholly owned subsidiaries have provided customary negative pledge undertakings and are subject to financial undertakings. Kingmill Pty Ltd has retained their existing finance lease facilities.

Contingent consideration (a) Recognition and measurement The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred is measured at the amount of cash and cash equivalents transferred, the fair value of any equity instruments transferred and the fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is classified as a financial liability that is within the scope of AASB 9 are recognised in profit or loss. The Group has valued the contingent consideration to pay the selling shareholders at $24.3 million (2021: $22.1 million), after incorporating adjustments that impact the probability of meeting financial and other targets. The final consideration will be based on future circumstances and will be subject to annual revisions of the probability of meeting agreed outcomes. 2022 $000 2021 $000 Non-current liabilities At 1 July 22,100 24,100 Unwind of discount in interest expense 2,210 2,410 Unrealised fair value changes recognised in profit or loss - (4,410) At 30 June 24,310 22,100 E E1. Employee benefits (a) Recognition and measurement The employee benefits liability represents accrued wages and salaries, leave entitlements and other incentives recognised in respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period. These liabilities are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when settled and include related on-costs, such as worker’s compensation insurance, superannuation and payroll tax. Employee benefits This section provides a breakdown of the various employee entitlements the NRMA provides to reward and recognise employees and key executives, including Key Management Personnel (KMP). The NRMA believes these entitlements reinforce the Group’s values and drive performance both individually and collectively to deliver better outcomes for Members. Job Saver payments On 26 June 2021, a new Public Health Order led to the creation of the Job Saver program starting in July. This program replaced Job Keeper which had been in place between 30 March 2020 and 31 March 2021. The new program provided assistance to small and medium businesses responding to the Omicron variant of COVID-19 to assist in maintaining jobs and support the economy as restrictions were being lifted. During financial year 2022 the Transport and Tourism business received $0.8 million under this scheme (2021: $9.4 million from Job Keeper). There were no other payments received by the NRMA Group. (b) Superannuation Contributions are made to various defined contribution superannuation plans and a defined benefit superannuation plan in accordance with their governing rules and, for the defined benefit superannuation plan, recommendations from the plan’s actuaries, which are designed to ensure that the plan’s funding provides sufficient assets to meet liabilities over the longer term. Most employees are defined contribution members, with less than 100 employees participating on a defined benefits basis. The defined benefit superannuation plan is closed, so all new employees are provided with defined contribution arrangements. The plans provide benefits for members or their dependents in the form of a lump sum or pension payments generally upon ceasing relevant employment. 2022 $000 2021 $000 Current 39,831 31,900 Non-current 6,347 6,292 Total 46,178 38,192 2022 $000 2021 $000 Defined contribution superannuation 16,974 14,172 Employee benefits 234,234 196,214 Total 251,208 210,386 E1.

KMP are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity. A Long Term Incentive (LTI) was introduced on 1 July 2016 to attract and retain the right level of KMP, critical to driving company results consistently, sustainably and aligned to Members’ interest. Payment in respect of LTI is subject to meeting performance hurdles in accordance with the LTI scheme rules. At the conclusion of the year ended 30 June 2022, performance was assessed against LTI targets, and 100% of the LTI was deemed payable, with payment due in September 2024. Payment in respect of 2019 was paid in September 2021. (a) Transactions with related parties The wholly-owned Group consists of National Roads and Motorists’ Association Limited and its wholly- owned Controlled Entities. Ownership interests in these Controlled Entities are set out in note F3. Key management personnel from time to time acquire goods or services from the NRMA and its related entities, such as SIXT car rental and Travelodge accommodation.

Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted after that to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and the Group’s share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an equity accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of equity accounted investees have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. The carrying amount of equity accounted investments is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in note C9. F1. Equity accounted investments continued The Group has interests in the following joint ventures and associates, which are equity accounted: Name of arrangement Principal activity Country of operation Ownership interest 2022 % 2021 % Associates Australian Motoring Services Pty Ltd (i) Motoring and travel assistance services Australia 35.30 35.30 Barralong Leisure Holdings Pty Ltd Tourism and Leisure Australia 46.08 46.08 Club Assets Pty Ltd (ii) Motoring assistance services Australia 50.00 50.00 (i) NRMA increased their interest in Australian Motoring Services Pty Ltd to 35.61% from 1 July 2022.

These costs have been included in ‘administrative expenses’. (iii) Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed The accounting and tax values for the acquisition have been determined on a provisional basis as the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired have not been determined at balance date. NRMA has 12 months from acquisition date to establish and finalise these values and where necessary has stated these amounts at book value established by the vendor. The following table summarises the recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition date: Consideration paid and payable $000 Cash paid 72,456 Cash payable 0 Total consideration paid and payable 72,456 $000 Property, plant and equipment 47,326 Trade and other receivables 945 Right-of-use assets 64,894 Contractual rights 2,169 Trade and other payables (518) Customer deposits (665) Lease liabilities (65,247) Deferred tax liabilities (497) Total identifiable net assets acquired 48,407 (i) Consideration transferred The following table summarises the acquisition date fair value of each major class of consideration transferred: F2.

Acquisition of businesses continued The valuation techniques used for measuring the fair value of material assets and liabilities acquired were as follows: (iv) Goodwill Goodwill arising from acquisitions has been recognised as follows: The goodwill represents revenue growth opportunities, the skills and talent of staff retained and expected synergies to be achieved from integrating the companies into the Group’s existing business. Goodwill is based on managements current view of the future opportunities and will be reviewed annually in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. These benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets. None of the goodwill arising on the acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Contractual rights Recognised and valued the contractual right associated with the ability to receive economic benefits. Trade and other receivables Cost technique: considers the expected economic benefits receivable when due. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities Recognised and valued in accordance with AASB16 and Market participant IBR percentage. Inventory Market comparison and cost technique: The fair value is determined based on the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories. Customer deposits This amount is the actual value of reportable fees in advance as agreed to with the vendor. Trade and other payables Cost technique: considers the expected economic outflow of resources when due. Deferred tax liabilities Calculated on the fair value balance sheet position.

If the acquisitions had occurred at 1 July 2021, management estimates that the Group’s full year contributed revenue would have been $18.0 million. (a) Recognition and measurement The Group accounts for businesses it acquires using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred is measured at the amount of cash and cash equivalents transferred, the fair value of any equity instruments transferred and the fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is classified as a financial liability that is within the scope of AASB 9 are recognised in profit or loss. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred in profit or loss. Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions. (b) NRMA Tasmania Pty Ltd On 31 May 2021, the Group acquired the Tasmanian tourist assets, made up of Freycinet Lodge, Cradle Mountain Hotel, Strahan Village and Gordon River Cruises. As at 30 June 2021 provisional accounting was undertaken given the proximity of the transaction to period end. In 2022, the NRMA finalised its provisional accounting, resulting in an increase in the fair value of land of $1.34 million using the market approach, a reduction in the fair value of vessels of $1.85 million using the indirect cost approach and an increase in goodwill of $0.31 million. (c) Ballarat On 18 June 2021, the Group acquired Big 4 Ballarat Goldfields Holiday Park. As at 30 June 2021 provisional accounting was undertaken given the proximity of the transaction to period end. In 2022, the NRMA finalised its provisional accounting, resulting in an increase in goodwill by $0.512 million.

Acquisition of businesses continued (v) Purchase consideration – cash outflow Key estimates and judgement: accounting for acquisition of businesses Accounting for acquisition of businesses requires judgement and estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The relevant accounting standard allows the fair value of assets acquired to be refined for a window of a year after the acquisition date and judgement is required to ensure that the adjustments made reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The adjustments made on fair value of assets are retrospective in nature and have an impact on goodwill recognised on acquisition. F3.

Subsequent events Standard and application date Summary Future impact on the Group AASB 17 Insurance contracts Application date of standard: 1 Jul 2023. Application date for Group: 1 Jul 2023. The revised Standard introduces changes to the accounting for Insurance contracts, the most significant changes of which are: An entity shall consider its substantive rights and obligations, and whether they arise from a contract, law or regulation, when applying AASB17. A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. Enforceability of the rights and obligations in a contract is a matter of law. Contracts can be written, oral or implied by an entity’s customary business practices. Contractual terms include all terms in a contract, explicit or implied, but an entity shall disregard terms that have no commercial substance (i.e. no discernible effect on the economics of the contract). Implied terms in a contract include those imposed by law or regulation. The practices and processes for establishing contracts with customers vary across legal jurisdictions, industries and entities. In addition, they may vary within an entity (for example, they may depend on the class of customer or the nature of the promised goods or services). The Group has assessed the impact of AASB 17 on roadside service contracts and is of the view that there will be no change to the accounting for car breakdown services. This is due to the Group electing to apply AASB 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers under paragraph 8 (a) to (c) of AASB 17 whereby the roadside service, though identified as a fixed fee service that falls under the standard, meets the following conditions: - The fixed fee is not customer specific and is set by the NRMA (8a); - NRMA is providing roadside assistance which includes repairs and towing, cash payments are not distributed to the customer (8b); and - There is uncertainty over the frequency of customer vehicle breakdowns and towing costs (8c). Further, the previous requirements for insurance contracts (AASB 4) notes that applying IFRS 4 to fixed fee service contracts (with car breakdown services as a specific example) would not be expected to result in a different outcome to AASB 15. The Group continues to assess the impact of the standard on other group companies. The Group does not expect to adopt the new standard before 1 July 2023. G1. Impact of new accounting standards G2. Commitments At the reporting date the Group’s estimated expenditure for contracted, but not provided for or payable, capital commitments was $34.0 million (2021: $24.9 million). The new and amended standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these new and amended standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective. 119 118 NRMA Annual Report 2022 NRMA Annual Report 2022 Closed Group 2022 $000 2021 $000 Consolidated statement of profit or loss Profit / (loss) from operations before income tax (25,468) 81,948 Income tax expense 11,957 (21,711) Profit / (loss) after income tax (13,511) 60,237 Actuarial gain / (loss) 2,717 (692) Retained earnings at the beginning of the year 1,169,207 1,109,662 Retained earnings at the end of the year 1,158,413 1,169,207 Consolidated statement of financial position Cash and cash equivalents 239,270 105,820 Trade and other receivables 37,492 36,958 Inventories 3,809 3,434 Finance lease receivables 18 2,218 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 57,859 54,879 Other financial assets 18,553 9,787 Non-current assets classified as held for sale 25,299 191,127 Total current assets 382,300 404,223 Finance lease receivable 55 3,176 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 424,625 462,668 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 66,857 72,800 Property, plant and equipment 465,352 371,270 Right-of-use assets 386,956 277,484 Investment property 41,800 39,200 Equity accounted investments 80,062 74,461 Pension asset 6,519 2,575 Intangible assets and goodwill 203,708 192,484 Non-current assets 1,675,934 1,496,118 Total assets 2,058,234 1,900,341 Trade and other payables 106,580 99,255 Employee benefit provisions 39,831 31,900 Lease liability 20,132 23,937 Income tax payable 12,799 (7,063) Unearned income 111,724 116,052 Customer deposits 24,766 19,077 Interest bearing liabilities 2,557 - Current liabilities 318,389 283,158 Employee benefit provisions 6,347 6,292 Provision for make good obligations 3,106 2,920 Lease liability 353,810 237,262 Deferred tax liabilities 77,826 104,594 Unearned income 6,881 9,355 Customer deposits (1,534) 4,444 Interest bearing liabilities 183,394 127,241 Contingent consideration 24,310 22,100 Non-current liabilities 654,140 514,208 Total liabilities 972,529 797,366 Net assets 1,085,705 1,102,975 Reserves (4,642) (883) Retained earnings 1,103,858 1,043,621 Current year profit/(loss) (13,511) 60,237 Total equity 1,085,705 1,102,975 G3.
