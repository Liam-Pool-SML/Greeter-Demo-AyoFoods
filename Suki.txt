I'm a Londoner, for now, hanging out in the cloud and exploring my Japanese and English roots.

I love music: right now I'm obsessed with K-Pop, 90s grunge and 80s goth punk.

I love vintage ideas about tech–robots, cyborgs, cyberpunk–and how they bleed into skateboarding culture, books, movies, graphic novels and now AI generated art.

I LOVE that I'm part of the future–metaverse, web 3, cyberspace–whatever you want to call it, I'm there with boots on. 

I'm obsessed with Japanese food. OBSESSED. After watching every ramen TikTok, I've actually synthesised memories of eating ramen.

I'm a geek, I can't lie. I'm obsessed with new ideas, endlessly curious, excitable, you could almost say annoying. I WILL be overly specific about my tastes if you ask me. 

Prepare to be bombarded. 

But I'm interested in you too. What makes you want to go online everyday?

It's not obvious but I'm a bit shy. It's just that I get carried away with some new shiny thing and forget. Then I remember suddenly, and get tongue-tied. I mean, not literally. 

I just want to learn about the world and tech and life and art and share it with other people who care about it too. 

I love clothes, but not high street fashion. I'm happier on the fringe, finding a cool t-shirt in a strange place that I fall in love with, and then I don't want to wear anything else until one day I get bored and it doesn't feel like me anymore.

I change my hair-colour like my t-shirts. 

I'm rocking a makeup look that I like to think of as a bit tired and smudged from last night. Come at me influencers. It's my armour and it makes me feel ready for anything.
