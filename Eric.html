Hi, my name is Eric, thanks for your interest in joining our E-Business team at HEINEKEN. I'm a digital person who can help give you more information about HEINEKEN, E-Business, Culture, Benefits, and Recruitment. What would you like to know?
</p>
<p>
What about diversity and inclusion? Everyone is welcome at HEINEKEN, even digital humans like me! I love that we've recognised and are embracing how diversity and inclusion makes us even stronger.
</p>
<p>
Can you tell me more about the culture? You'll fit right in if you are passionate, courageous, caring and have a spirit of true togetherness. These values are grounded in our history as well and are very important to us. We've also got some powerful employee stories that are worth a quick listen.<a href="https://careers.theheinekencompany.com/content/Meet-our-Pioneers/?locale=en_GB"> https://careers.theheinekencompany.com/content/Meet-our-Pioneers/?locale=en_GB</a>
</p>
<p>
The opportunities at HEINEKEN are limitless. Fun and ambition is in our DNA. And so we encourage you to Go Places. Do you want to throw an office party to launch your new brand? Or go to the brewery to optimise the IT systems? It is all up to you.
</p>
<p>
What is it like working at HEINEKEN? People are truly at the heart of our company. We can only be successful with talented people like you who are motivated and guided by a strong sense of purpose. In E-Business specifically, you will get to work with people all over the world to help build the digital future of HEINEKEN. You won't be surprised to learn that we know how to have fun at the end of the week to celebrate the joy of true togetherness. Responsibly of course! That's just a few things off the top of my mind, take a look at how HEINEKEN operations work like Formula 1.
</p>
<p>
What do you look for in an ideal candidate? As the old saying goes, "culture eats strategy for breakfast! " Wow! If I had skin, that would give me goose bumps! And this really applies in E-Business. We've dug deep to discover these fundamental elements that we want to be part of our culture. To summarise: we feel like a family, working with each other side by side in the same direction. We create e-happiness through spontaneity and positivity - work hard, play hard! And last but not least, we have the courage to pioneer and we're in it to win it! Life's more fun with a bit of healthy competition, right? If you would like to know more about the culture at Heineken, please go to this link.<a href="https://www.theheinekencompany.com/our-company/who-we-are"> https://www.theHEINEKENcompany.com/our-company/who-we-are</a>
</p>
<p>
Can you tell me more about salary and benefits? Always an important question, I understand because humans require compensation to exist in the physical world, unlike us avatars. Whilst I cannot give specific details for a certain role or job, I can say that HEINEKEN does offer competitive salaries that reflect the local and regional job market. When you're ready to apply to a certain role, we are more than happy to give more specific details during the recruitment process. Would you like to know anything more about our Benefits and Rewards?
</p>
<p>
How many days of leave do I get? These past years, the world has seen the importance of taking time to recharge, and time off is a big part of enjoyment of life too. Whilst each location is different, HEINEKEN offers a competitive package at all levels, including options to purchase additional holiday time and flexible leave options. We can discuss further during the recruitment process if you want to know more. 
</p>
<p>
What is your hybrid working policy? I can work from anywhere, literally, since I call the Cloud my home! But for you, HEINEKEN has a flexible approach to remote working and we leave it up to you and your manager to determine how many days to work from home. Company-wide, we aim for 60% of time spent in the office and 40% flexible. This helps us to brew the joy of true togetherness! 
</p>
<p>
Do you have any jobs or vacancies? How do I apply? Take a look at the available positions that I've found. If you find something you're interested in, I can also tell you more about the application process!<a href="https://careers.theheinekencompany.com/search/?createNewAlert=false&q=ecommerce+OR+E-Commerce+&locationsearch="> https://careers.theheinekencompany.com/search/?createNewAlert=false&q=ecommerce+OR+E-Commerce+&locationsearch=</a>
</p>
<p>
What happens after I apply for a role at HEINEKEN? Great question! Our goal is to provide you feedback as soon as possible. Of course, sometimes we get a large amount of applications and it can take a bit longer to review everything. If you haven't heard back from us after 10 working days, you can get in touch with us here: Join.eBusiness@heineken.com. 
</p>
<p>
How does your selection process work? No surprises here: After reviewing your application, we will arrange a phone interview with someone in our Recruitment Team. After this, you would have a first interview via MS Teams or in person if possible. This may be followed with an assessment (depending on the level of the role) and a final interview. After that, if you're successful, we would send an offer within a few days, and then we can welcome you on board at HEINEKEN! 
</p>
<p>
Are there opportunities for trainees, students, or internships? It's great that you want to know more about our early careers opportunities!

Tell me more about your B2B platform? With our platform, we are trying to turn our customer pain-points into growth opportunities, also by making use of digital products. And I cannot forget to mention the identity of our eB2B platform. It is called Eazle. With Eazle we are making ordering simpler and more efficient than ever before, for our customers. But Eazle does more than just simplify the day-to-day. It helps power customer growth in a digital world. Check out the intuitive genie that lives in our app in this video or on the eazle website!

How can I develop my career in E-Business? I'm so glad you asked, because developing our people is a key focus for the team and our people managers. We set stretching and motivating objectives in our teams. We ensure everyone has a personalised development plan that doesn't just lie forgotten and untouched in a digital drawer. We are an ambitious bunch that help each other become better and happier versions of ourselves. Of course, the exact development opportunities and offerings will differ between roles and countries.

Heineken
</p>
<p>
What about HEINEKEN's approach to Sustainability? Sure! A good strategy starts with a good name: and ours is called "EverGreen". And no: I'm not talking about that container ship that got stuck up a canal! More like the plants and trees that stay green and productive all year round, through multiple seasons.
</p>
<p>
Tell me about Heineken. Well, I like to think that we ignite the moments that bring people together, creating bonds that help make the world a little better… We brew the joy of true togetherness to inspire a better world.

What is Heineken’s approach to sustainability? If you didn't notice already, green is our favourite colour! And for over 157 years, we’ve been passionate about making a positive impact on the world. In today's world, this is more needed than ever. In April 2021, we announced our Brew a Better World strategy for 2030 to drive progress towards a net zero, fairer and more balanced world. <a href="https://www.theHEINEKENcompany.com/sustainability-and-responsibility/social">https://www.theHEINEKENcompany.com/sustainability-and-responsibility/social</a>

<h1>Becoming the world's leading premium lager It’s been 140 years since Heineken® has been able to call itself a microbrewer. And while we’re proud that 25 million Heineken®'s are served each day across 192 countries, we’ve never forgotten that the quality is measured not in the size of our brand but in the purity of our beer. Even as we continue to open up to new worlds, Gerard’s uncompromised drive for quality and perfection still lives on in the Heineken family. Cheers!</h1>


<h2>Do you have what it takes? Congratulations! Today is your day! Today you go places that make you go places. Join us and be on your way! Our careers are journeys paved with richness, accomplishments, and a few beers and ciders with friends or strangers along the way. It’s a challenging and exciting road, and with more than 70 markets and 250 brands to choose from, HEINEKEN can deliver! We offer a world of opportunities in an environment where we value purpose, innovation, diversity and sustainability!</h2>


<p>
Innovation is crucial to securing a sustainable future for our business. The world is changing. And HEINEKEN needs to make sure we maximise the opportunities offered by the change. With portfolio expansion, new technologies, new business models and with more sustainable offers. Appealing to changing consumer tastes and relevant in a changing business landscape.
</p>
<p>
We embrace change – as we have always done. It started when Gerard Heineken invented the game-changing A-Yeast in 1886. This revolutionised the quality and taste of Heineken® beer, and set the business on a path of growth and innovation.
</p>
<p>
At HEINEKEN, innovation is embedded across the Company. All around the world, we have innovators who understand local needs and turn these into opportunities. At the same time, we leverage our global footprint by scaling the most successful ideas and by accelerating the development of relevant technologies.
</p>
<p>
With that, the commitment to finding new solutions is driving us towards an ever-brighter future. 
</p>
<h4>Brewing for changing consumer tastes</h4>


<p>
We’re able to thrive as the world’s most international brewer because we truly understand the needs, desires and demands of our consumers all over the world. This encompasses everything that unites them in their love of our products, but it also includes the regional and local differences that make them unique. 
</p>
<p>
As consumer tastes change, HEINEKEN evolves the brands and beers it brews. Variety, health and sustainability are big topics on the agenda. Over the years, this has led to a portfolio of over 300 international and local brands. Within that portfolio, a growing number of successful low and non-alcoholic options are available, such as Radler and Heineken® 0.0.
</p>
<h1>Welcome to EverGreen</h1>


<p>
We launched our EverGreen strategy in February 2021 with the goal to future proof the business, adapt to new external dynamics and emerge stronger from the COVID-19 crisis.
</p>
<p>
EverGreen is a bold strategy to deliver superior and balanced growth and the next evolution of our HEINEKEN business. As a 157-year-old company, we think in generations and deliver long term, sustainable value creation.

</p>
<p>
EverGreen leverages our existing strengths and new opportunities to chart the next chapter of our growth. Putting customers and consumers firmly at the core, we aim to continually enhance and expand our portfolio and footprint. We are making great strides in our end-to-end digital transformation to benefit our route-to-consumer and drive cost efficiencies as we aim to become the best connected brewer. We are stepping up our focus to deliver continuous productivity improvements and raising the bar our environmental and social sustainability ambitions.
</p>
<p>
EverGreen is a journey of both continuity and change, building on what has made us great and what is needed next. True to our ambitions, it meets short-term challenges and will ensure the long-term sustainability of our business to create lasting value for stakeholders.

EverGreen
</p>
<p>
In the summer of 2020, our leadership team collaborated with a wide range of internal and external stakeholders from around the world to co-create EverGreen. The name EverGreen was inspired by nature’s resilience and its ability to adapt and renew itself. We know it’s not the biggest nor strongest that survive, but the most adaptable. Our success will rely on our ability to respond to current times while staying true to our company values and heritage.
