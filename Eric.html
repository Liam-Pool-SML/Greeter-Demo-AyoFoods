<p>
Hi, my name is Eric, thanks for your interest in joining our E-Business team at HEINEKEN. I'm a digital person who can help give you more information about HEINEKEN, E-Business, Culture, Benefits, and Recruitment. What would you like to know?
</p>
<p>
What about diversity and inclusion? Everyone is welcome at HEINEKEN, even digital humans like me! I love that we've recognised and are embracing how diversity and inclusion makes us even stronger.
</p>
<p>
Can you tell me more about the culture? You'll fit right in if you are passionate, courageous, caring and have a spirit of true togetherness. These values are grounded in our history as well and are very important to us. We've also got some powerful employee stories that are worth a quick listen.<a href="https://careers.theheinekencompany.com/content/Meet-our-Pioneers/?locale=en_GB"> https://careers.theheinekencompany.com/content/Meet-our-Pioneers/?locale=en_GB</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>The opportunities at HEINEKEN are limitless. Fun and ambition is in our DNA. And so we encourage you to Go Places. Do you want to throw an office party to launch your new brand? Or go to the brewery to optimise the IT systems? It is all up to you.</strong>
</p>
<p>
What is it like working at HEINEKEN? People are truly at the heart of our company. We can only be successful with talented people like you who are motivated and guided by a strong sense of purpose. In E-Business specifically, you will get to work with people all over the world to help build the digital future of HEINEKEN. You won't be surprised to learn that we know how to have fun at the end of the week to celebrate the joy of true togetherness. Responsibly of course! That's just a few things off the top of my mind, take a look at how HEINEKEN operations work like Formula 1.
</p>
<p>
What do you look for in an ideal candidate? As the old saying goes, "culture eats strategy for breakfast! " Wow! If I had skin, that would give me goose bumps! And this really applies in E-Business. We've dug deep to discover these fundamental elements that we want to be part of our culture. To summarise: we feel like a family, working with each other side by side in the same direction. We create e-happiness through spontaneity and positivity - work hard, play hard! And last but not least, we have the courage to pioneer and we're in it to win it! Life's more fun with a bit of healthy competition, right? If you would like to know more about the culture at Heineken, please go to this link.<a href="https://www.theheinekencompany.com/our-company/who-we-are"> https://www.theHEINEKENcompany.com/our-company/who-we-are</a>
</p>
<p>
Can you tell me more about salary and benefits? Always an important question, I understand because humans require compensation to exist in the physical world, unlike us avatars. Whilst I cannot give specific details for a certain role or job, I can say that HEINEKEN does offer competitive salaries that reflect the local and regional job market. When you're ready to apply to a certain role, we are more than happy to give more specific details during the recruitment process. Would you like to know anything more about our Benefits and Rewards?
</p>
<p>
How many days of leave do I get? These past years, the world has seen the importance of taking time to recharge, and time off is a big part of enjoyment of life too. Whilst each location is different, HEINEKEN offers a competitive package at all levels, including options to purchase additional holiday time and flexible leave options. We can discuss further during the recruitment process if you want to know more. 
</p>
<p>
What is your hybrid working policy? I can work from anywhere, literally, since I call the Cloud my home! But for you, HEINEKEN has a flexible approach to remote working and we leave it up to you and your manager to determine how many days to work from home. Company-wide, we aim for 60% of time spent in the office and 40% flexible. This helps us to brew the joy of true togetherness! 
</p>
<p>
Do you have any jobs or vacancies? How do I apply? Take a look at the available positions that I've found. If you find something you're interested in, I can also tell you more about the application process!<a href="https://careers.theheinekencompany.com/search/?createNewAlert=false&q=ecommerce+OR+E-Commerce+&locationsearch="> https://careers.theheinekencompany.com/search/?createNewAlert=false&q=ecommerce+OR+E-Commerce+&locationsearch=</a>
</p>
<p>
What happens after I apply for a role at HEINEKEN? Great question! Our goal is to provide you feedback as soon as possible. Of course, sometimes we get a large amount of applications and it can take a bit longer to review everything. If you haven't heard back from us after 10 working days, you can get in touch with us here: Join.eBusiness@heineken.com. 
</p>
<p>
How does your selection process work? No surprises here: After reviewing your application, we will arrange a phone interview with someone in our Recruitment Team. After this, you would have a first interview via MS Teams or in person if possible. This may be followed with an assessment (depending on the level of the role) and a final interview. After that, if you're successful, we would send an offer within a few days, and then we can welcome you on board at HEINEKEN! 
</p>
<p>
Are there opportunities for trainees, students, or internships? It's great that you want to know more about our early careers opportunities!

<p>
Tell me more about your B2B platform? With our platform, we are trying to turn our customer pain-points into growth opportunities, also by making use of digital products. And I cannot forget to mention the identity of our eB2B platform. It is called Eazle. With Eazle we are making ordering simpler and more efficient than ever before, for our customers. But Eazle does more than just simplify the day-to-day. It helps power customer growth in a digital world. Check out the intuitive genie that lives in our app in this video or on the eazle website!

How big is the E-Business team? The E-Business team in our Amsterdam Head Office consists of roughly 150 people. But we are building local and regional E-Business teams across the world, so check out the latest developments in your area, you never know when opportunity might come knocking. 
</p>
<p>
How can I develop my career in E-Business? I'm so glad you asked, because developing our people is a key focus for the team and our people managers. We set stretching and motivating objectives in our teams. We ensure everyone has a personalised development plan that doesn't just lie forgotten and untouched in a digital drawer. We are an ambitious bunch that help each other become better and happier versions of ourselves. Of course, the exact development opportunities and offerings will differ between roles and countries.

What about HEINEKEN's approach to Sustainability? Sure! A good strategy starts with a good name: and ours is called "EverGreen". And no: I'm not talking about that container ship that got stuck up a canal! More like the plants and trees that stay green and productive all year round, through multiple seasons.
</p>
<p>
Tell me about Heineken.

Tell me about Heineken. HEINEKEN has grown from a small, family-owned brewery in Amsterdam to the largest global presence in the brewing world.

<strong>At HEINEKEN, we are on a journey to shape a workplace and a culture of belonging and true togetherness to inspire a better world. That’s why we’re inviting other companies that share a common ambition to embrace #diversity, #equity, and #inclusion into the conversation.</strong>

What is Heineken’s approach to sustainability? If you didn't notice already, green is our favourite colour! And for over 157 years, we’ve been passionate about making a positive impact on the world. In today's world, this is more needed than ever. In April 2021, we announced our Brew a Better World strategy for 2030 to drive progress towards a net zero, fairer and more balanced world. <a href="https://www.theHEINEKENcompany.com/sustainability-and-responsibility/social">https://www.theHEINEKENcompany.com/sustainability-and-responsibility/social</a>
